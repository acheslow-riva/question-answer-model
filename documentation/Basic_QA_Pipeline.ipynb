The three aims are: \\n\\tBetter Care : Improve overall quality, by making health care more patient centered, reliable, accessible, safe, and focused on achieving meaningful health outcomes. \\n\\tHealthy People/Healthy Communities : Improve the health of the U.S. population by supporting proven interventions to address behavioral, social, and, environmental determinants of health in addition to delivering higher quality care. \\n\\tAffordable Care : Reduce the cost of quality health care for individuals, families, employers, and government. \\n\\tThe health care system is highly complex. The scope of the challenge to achieve these three aims is illustrated in the figures in this section. Progress toward these aims is discussed in the sections that follow. Millions of health care workers in a variety of settings deliver billions of services each year.

       " {'text': 'Reopening a closed (\"shuttered\") hospital to expand surge capacity in an emergency requires significant planning. This Toolkit is a step-by-step guide to assist staff responsible for management, legal, facility, staffing, security, materials management, and transportation planning. The kit includes sections for each staff type/responsibility. The sections address: \\n\\tDescription:  As part of overall homeland security and disaster response planning at the local, county, or State level, the need for additional hospital surge capacity may be an identified issue. If response planners choose to pursue use of area shuttered hospitals for surge capacity, key local authorities will need to come together to make these plans a reality. Local authorities should seek guidance from the Federal Government as part of this process. \\n\\tIdentify all authorities/agencies/organizations having interest in and/or jurisdiction over hospital surge capacity planning in the region. Examples include: major hospitals, public health departments, homeland security officials, emergency management authorities, emergency medical system authorities, fire departments, and police officials.\\n\\tCollect, review, and assess existing homeland security and disaster response plans for the area. Identify any overlap or restriction on the efforts to create surge capacity readiness at a local shuttered hospital. \\n\\tFormalize a surge facility planning and management team. Expertise in the following areas is needed, with preference for those with knowledge about operating under emergency conditions. \\n\\tDisaster response/emergency management coordination (management, coordination of work with involvement of multiple entities).\\n\\tDesignate a team leader with responsibility for maintaining contact with the team, arranging meetings, and representing the team as needed (with press, at larger scope emergency planning meetings, etc.). \\n\\tDescription:  A critical component of the surge facility planning will be to determine who will be in charge of operating the surge facility when it is needed. Ideally, a major hospital in the area will have this responsibility so that the surge facility acts as a temporary satellite of the major hospital with the benefits of use of hospital contracts, staff, equipment, and expertise. This may not be feasible in all cases, so an alternate plan must be developed. Also, a reporting structure and chain of command must be formalized so that coordination between the organizations involved occurs smoothly. \\n\\t',\n",

Ideally, one or a few of the shuttered hospitals will then be selected for surge capacity use readiness preparations. \\n\\tObtain a list of all shuttered hospitals in the area (likely available from State departments of public health). \\n\\tSelect best candidates for surge use from list of shuttered hospitals. Preferred characteristics include:\\n\\tContact current facility owners to discuss possible surge use and obtain permission for facility walkthrough. \\n\\tFacility Expert(s) (hospital knowledge preferred, HVAC-licensed, general knowledge of multiple facility issues, structural, plumbing, etc.). \\n\\tManagement team experts begin readiness preparations in their area of focus: staffing, security, facility, etc.). \\n\\tDescription:  Once readiness activities—such as arrangement of contracts and partner agreements, identification of providers, and procurement of limited equipment—have been completed, a periodic review must be conducted to ensure that readiness is maintained. \\n\\tFor example, over time staff or ownership of key partners or vendors may change, the target facility may be sold, or regulatory changes or technological advancements may have occurred that affect readiness plans. For this reason, surge facility plans and prearrangements must be reviewed periodically to ensure that they are active and appropriate. \\n\\tTimeframe:  Once surge facility preparedness plans and arrangements are finalized, they should be reviewed every 6 months. The management team should meet once a year to reassess the surge facility plans compared with current surge capacity needs and broad-scope regional emergency planning efforts. \\n\\tThe management team leader contacts the target surge facility owners to check the facility status (any changes in condition, use, plans for the facility, or ownership). \\n\\tIf a new target surge facility or facilities are needed, the team will reassess the list of shuttered facilities and conduct new facility walkthroughs as needed. \\n\\tEach team member conducts a status check with all vendors or other providers for every advance contract or formal arrangement under their focus area. Partner organizations are contacted for a status check. \\n\\tThe team meets annually to review the overall surge facility plans and scenarios and assess the fit with current regional needs and broader emergency planning efforts. \\n\\tManagement team members are replaced as needed if a member changes jobs, is unable to fulfill his or her duties, etc. \\n\\tDescription:  Once the catastrophic event occurs, facility opening efforts will be under way through the efforts of individual management team members overseeing their area of focus (staffing, security, supplies, etc.). However, there should also be big-picture management team oversight to ensure that nothing is missed and to provide extra assistance as needed. \\n\\tTimeframe:  As soon as the catastrophic event occurs, through implementation of planned arrangements for opening the facility and the facility opening day. \\n\\tManagement team leader checks in with each team member to ensure that facility opening activities are under way. \\n\\tManagement team leader assists with troubleshooting or procuring additional assistance or resources as needed. \\n\\tDescription:  Once needed staffing, equipment, and supplies are in place, and the facility has accepted patients, efforts will be needed to maintain fully operational status. Management team members will continue to oversee their area of focus. However, there should also be big-picture management team oversight to ensure that smooth operations are maintained, and to provide extra assistance as needed. \\n\\tTimeframe:  The operations activities listed below will begin on opening day and continue until the facility is closed. \\n\\tManagement team leader conducts periodic checks with each team member to ensure continuation of effective facility operations. This should occur every few days at the beginning, and once a week as the facility continues operations. \\n\\tManagement team leader assists with troubleshooting or procuring additional assistance or resources as needed. \\n\\tDescription:  Shutdown of the surge facility will require removal of equipment and termination of ongoing contracts or arrangements. Management team members will oversee shut-down activities in their area of focus. However, there should also be big-picture management team oversight to ensure that facility shutdown occurs smoothly and quickly and to provide extra assistance as needed. \\n\\tTimeframe:  Once all patients can be discharged or transported back to the major hospital for continued care, and there is no ongoing surge capacity need, the facility can be closed. The shutdown should be expedited so that the facility can be returned to the control of the existing owners quickly and should be possible within a matter of days. \\n\\tManagement team leader checks in periodically with each team member to ensure initiation and completion of shutdown activities in that member's area of focus. \\n\\tManagement team leader assists with problem troubleshooting or procuring additional assistance or resources as needed. \\n\\tManagement team leader or designate conducts a facility walkthrough with the facility owner when shutdown activities are completed to ensure that removal of equipment and supplies, cleaning, and other surge closure activities have been completed to the owner's satisfaction. \\n\\tDescription:  In the unfortunate event that a terrorist incident or disaster occurs, and the facility must be opened for surge use, valuable lessons will be learned during operations. This information should be captured so that surge facility readiness and operation plans can be improved in preparation for any future surge use. \\n\\tReview outsourced services (food preparation, laundry, laboratory) for problems or suggested improvements or to see if in-house capacity should be developed for future surge use. \\n\\tThis table summarizes the most important Federal and State regulations and identifies those that may require waivers and those that probably do not. \\n\\tFor an extensive discussion of the legal and regulatory issues surrounding reopening a shuttered hospital, go to  Appendix D in the  Reopening Shuttered Hospital to Expand Surge Capacity  report. \\n\\t\",\n",

More than 16 million Americans are covered by Medicare Advantage plans, which are offered by private insurers as alternatives to traditional Medicare. For each year that enrollees remained in their Medicare Advantage plans, researchers found, premium and out-of-pocket costs increased by roughly $50. Beneficiaries who remained in their plans for six or more years were most at risk of spending higher amounts, paying $786 more each year than they would have spent in the lowest-cost plan available to them.

A recent systematic review identified over 40 definitions of the term \"care coordination.\" 2  The systematic review authors combined the common elements from many definitions to develop one working definition for use in identifying reviews of interventions in the vicinity of care coordination and, as a result, developed a purposely broad definition:  \"Care coordination is the deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient\\'s care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services. Organizing care involves the marshalling of personnel and other resources needed to carry out all required patient care activities and is often managed by the exchange of information among participants responsible for different aspects of care.\"  For some purposes, they noted that other definitions may be more appropriate. This lack of consensus is perhaps not surprising given the many different participants involved in coordinating care. \\n\\t',\n",

Transitions occur when information about or accountability/responsibility for some aspect of a patient's care is transferred between two or more health care entities, or is maintained over time by one entity.

Quick Reference Guide for Clinicians. Rockville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service. April 2009. \\n\\tTobacco is the single greatest cause of disease and premature death in America today, and is responsible for more than 435,000 deaths annually. About 20 percent of adult Americans currently smoke, and 4,000 children and adolescents smoke their first cigarette each day. The societal costs of tobacco-related death and disease approach $96 billion annually in medical expenses and $97 billion in lost productivity. However, more then 70 percent of all current smokers have expressed a desire to stop smoking; if they successfully quit, the result will be both immediate and long-term health improvements. Clinicians have a vital role to play in helping smokers quit. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'The analyses within the Clinical Practice Guideline  Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update  demonstrated that efficacious treatments for tobacco users exist and should become a part of standard care giving. Research also shows that delivering such treatments is cost-effective. In summary, the treatment of tobacco use and dependence presents the best and most cost-effective opportunity for clinicians to improve the lives of millions of Americans nationwide. \\n\\tTobacco dependence is a chronic disease that often requires repeated intervention and multiple attempts to quit. Effective treatments exist, however, that can significantly increase rates of long-term abstinence. \\n\\tIt is essential that clinicians and healthcare delivery systems consistently identify and document tobacco use status and treat every tobacco user seen in a healthcare setting. \\n\\tTobacco dependence treatments are effective across a broad range of populations. Clinicians should encourage every patient willing to make a quit attempt to use the recommended counseling treatments and medications in the Guideline. \\n\\tBrief tobacco dependence treatment is effective. Clinicians should offer every patient who uses tobacco at least the brief treatments shown to be effective in the Guideline. \\n\\tIndividual, group and telephone counseling are effective and their effectiveness increases with treatment intensity. Two components of counseling are especially effective and clinicians should use these when counseling patients making a quit attempt:\\n\\tThere are numerous effective medications for tobacco dependence and clinicians should encourage their use by all patients attempting to quit smoking, except when medically contraindicated or with specific populations for which there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness (i.e., pregnant women, smokeless tobacco users, light smokers and adolescents).\\n\\t Seven first-line medications (5 nicotine and 2 non-nicotine) reliably increase long-term smoking abstinence rates:\\n\\tClinicians should also consider the use of certain combinations of medications identified as effective in the Guideline. \\n\\tCounseling and medication are effective when used by themselves for treating tobacco dependence. However, the combination of counseling and medication is more effective than either alone. Thus, clinicians should encourage all individuals making a quit attempt to use both counseling and medication. \\n\\tTelephone quitline counseling is effective with diverse populations and has broad reach. Therefore, clinicians and healthcare delivery systems should both ensure patient access to quitlines and promote quitline use. \\n\\tIf a tobacco user is currently unwilling to make a quit attempt, clinicians should use the motivational treatments shown in the Guideline to be effective in increasing future quit attempts. \\n\\tTobacco dependence treatments are both clinically effective and highly cost-effective relative to interventions for other clinical disorders. Providing coverage for these treatments increases quit rates. Insurers and purchasers should ensure that all insurance plans include the counseling and medication identified as effective in the Guideline as covered benefits. \\n\\tTobacco dependence is a chronic health condition that often requires multiple, discrete interventions by a clinician or team of clinicians. The \"5 A\\'s\" of treating tobacco dependence (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange follow-up) is a useful way to understand tobacco dependence treatment and organize the clinical team to deliver that treatment. While a single clinician can provide all 5 A\\'s, it is often more clinically and cost-effective to have the 5 A\\'s implemented by a team of clinicians and ancillary staff. However when a team is used, coordination of efforts is essential with a single clinician retaining overall responsibility for the interventions. Clinician extenders such as quit lines, Web-based interventions, local quit programs and tailored, self-help materials can often be, and should be, incorporated into the 5 A\\'s approach. These treatment extenders can make clinical interventions more efficient. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'This Quick Reference Guide for Clinicians is organized around the 5 A\\'s. However, the clinical situation may suggest delivering these components in a different order or format. The following sections address the three main groups of tobacco users: \\n\\tThis Quick Reference Guide for Clinicians is based on Guideline findings and includes many tables directly from the Guideline. \\xa0 \\n\\tFor the ex-tobacco user, how recent did you quit and are there any challenges to remaining abstinent? \\n\\tFor the patient willing to make a quit attempt, offer medication and provide or refer for counseling or additional behavioral treatment to help the patient quit. \\n\\tFor patients unwilling to quit at this time, provide motivational interventions designed to increase future quit attempts. \\n\\tThe \"5 A\\'s,\"  Ask ,  Advise ,  Assess ,  Assist , and  Arrange , are designed to be used with the smoker who is willing to quit. \\xa0 \\n\\tImplement an office-wide system that ensures that, for  every  patient at  every  clinic visit, tobacco-use status is queried and documented. a \\n\\tExpand the vital signs to include tobacco use or use an alternative universal identification system. b \\n\\t  a  Repeated assessment is not necessary in the case of the adult who has never used tobacco or has not used tobacco for many years and for whom this information is clearly documented in the medical record.   b  Alternatives to expanding the vital signs include using tobacco use status stickers on all patient charts or indicating tobacco use status via electronic medical records or computerized reminder systems. \\xa0 \\n\\t\\t\\t Clear —\"I think it is important for you to quit smoking (or using chewing tobacco) now and I can help you.\" \\n\\tStrong —\"As your clinician, I need you to know that quitting smoking is the most important thing you can do to protect your health now and in the future. The clinic staff and I will help you.\" \\n\\tPersonalized —Tie tobacco use to current symptoms and health concerns, and/or its social and economic costs, and/or the impact of tobacco use on children and others in the household. “Continuing to smoke makes your asthma worse, and quitting may dramatically improve your health. Quitting smoking may reduce the number of ear infections your child has.” \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t If the patient will participate in an intensive treatment, deliver such a treatment or link/refer to an intensive intervention. \\n\\tIf the patient is a member of a special population (e.g., adolescent, pregnant smoker, racial/ethnic minority), consider providing additional information. \\n\\tIf the patient clearly states he or she is unwilling to make a quit attempt at this time, provide an intervention shown to increase future quit attempts. \\n\\tAnticipate  challenges to planned quit attempt, particularly during the critical first few weeks. These include nicotine withdrawal symptoms. \\n\\tRemove  tobacco products from your environment. Prior to quitting, avoid smoking in places where you spend a lot of time (e.g., work, home, car). Make your home smoke-free. \\n\\tRecommend the use of approved medication, except when contraindicated or with specific populations for which there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness (i.e., pregnant women, smokeless tobacco users, light smokers, and adolescents). \\n\\tExplain how these medications increase quitting success and reduce withdrawal symptoms. FDA-approved medications include: bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine lozenge, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine patch, and varenicline. There is insufficient evidence to recommend medication for pregnant women, adolescents, smokeless tobacco users, and light smokers (< 10 cigarettes/day). \\n\\tPast quit experience.  Identify what helped and what hurt in previous quit attempts. Build on past success. \\n\\tAnticipate triggers or challenges in the upcoming attempt . Discuss challenges/triggers and how the patient will successfully overcome them (e.g., avoid triggers, alter routines).. \\n\\tAlcohol . Because alcohol is associated with relapse, the patient should consider limiting/abstaining from alcohol while quitting. (Note that reducing alcohol intake could precipitate withdrawal in alcohol-dependent persons.) \\n\\tOther smokers in the household . Quitting is more difficult when there is another smoker in the household. Patients should encourage housemates to quit with them or to not smoke in their presence. \\n\\tHelp patient develop social support for his or her quit attempt in his or her environments outside of treatment. \"Ask your spouse/partner, friends, and coworkers to support you in your quit attempt.\" \\n\\tSources:  Federal agencies, nonprofit agencies, national quitline network (1-800-QUIT-NOW), or local/state/tribal health departments/quitlines. \\n\\tCounseling should include teaching practical problem solving skills and providing support and encouragement. \\xa0 \\n\\tRecognize danger situations —Identify events, internal states, or activities that increase the risk of smoking or relapse. \\n\\tDevelop coping skills —Identify and practice coping or problem-solving skills. Typically, these skills are intended to cope with danger situations. \\n\\tAccomplishing lifestyle changes that reduce stress, improve quality of life, and reduce exposure to smoking cues. \\n\\tLearning cognitive and behavioral activities to cope with smoking urges (e.g., distracting attention; changing routines). \\n\\tWithdrawal symptoms typically peak within 1-2 weeks after quitting but may persist for months. These symptoms include negative mood, urges to smoke, and difficulty concentrating. \\n\\tPoint out that counseling plus medication works better than medication alone. Explain that the goal of counseling (or coaching) is to provide the practical skills that increase the likelihood of quitting successfully. Use the motivational interventions designed for tobacco users who do not want to quit to encourage your patient to accept counseling. Emphasize the inconsistency between not using effective counseling for something as important and difficult as quitting tobacco. If the patient still declines counseling, consider providing medication alone because medication alone has been shown to be effective. During followup, continue to provide the key elements of counseling: problem solving, practical skills, and support. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'My patient wants to use a method of quitting not known to be effective such as acupuncture, hypnosis, or laser therapy. What do I do? \\n\\tAsk the patient to consider increasing the success odds of his/her quit attempt by augmenting his/her method of quitting with evidence-based medication and counseling. Do not denigrate any attempt to quit. If the patient declines, support his/her effort, but ask for an agreement that, should it not be successful, the patient will consider evidence-based methods in the future, including medication and counseling. \\n\\tRecommend that the patient start or increase physical activity. For example, take a walk at break time rather than smoke and/or walk at lunch. Also see medication recommendations for such patients. \\n\\tMy patient is concerned about using NRT because he/she believes nicotine to be one of the harmful ingredients in tobacco products. \\n\\tExplain that medicinal nicotine by itself is relatively safe. Emphasize that the 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke, including about 40 carcinogens, cause the harm from smoking. Also, medicinal nicotine has been proven to greatly reduce withdrawal symptoms in many people. \\n\\tDoubt that recovery is possible if medication containing nicotine is used, having recovered from another dependency. \\n\\t\\t\\t Medication delivered by mouth or through a patch is not like smoking. Developing a dependency on the medication is uncommon. \\n\\tThe ultimate goal remains neither smoking nor using medication; the use of nicotine-containing medication is a transition step toward that goal. \\n\\tAcknowledge that for many people smoking is one way to deal with stress. But it is only one way. Counseling will help him/her develop new ways to cope. It will take some time. At first the new ways may feel less effective but the longer the patient is away from smoking, the easier it will be to handle stress without smoking. Also his/her health will be so much better. \\n\\tMy patient says he/she has been smoking for many (20, 30, or more) years without any health problems, plus his/her grandfather smoked two packs a day and lived to be 105. \\n\\tConsider saying something like, \"There are certainly people who smoke for many years without apparent tobacco-related diseases. But about half of people who smoke will die from a tobacco-related illness. The average smoker lives 10 years less than non-smokers. I know it is hard to quit, but is that any reason to gamble with your health when you know that there is a 50-percent chance you will die from a tobacco-related disease?\" \\n\\tSee FDA package insert warning regarding suicidality and antidepressant drugs when used in children, adolescents, and young adults. \\n\\t  a  Based on the 2008 Clinical Practice Guideline:  Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence , U.S. Public Health Service, May 2008. Refer to the FDA Web site for additional dosing and safety information, including safety protocols. \\xa0 \\n\\tWho should receive medication for tobacco use? Are there groups of smokers for whom medication has not been shown to be effective? \\n\\tAll smokers trying to quit should be offered medication, except where contraindicated or for specific populations for which there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness (i.e., pregnant women, smokeless tobacco users, light smokers, and adolescents). \\n\\tAll seven of the FDA-approved medications for treating tobacco use are recommended: bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine lozenge, nicotine nasal spray, the nicotine patch, and varenicline. The clinician should consider the first-line medications shown to be more effective than the nicotine patch alone: 2 mg/day varenicline or the combination of long-term nicotine patch use + ad libitum NRT. Unfortunately, there are no well-accepted algorithms to guide optimal selection among the first-line medications. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'The higher dose preparations of nicotine gum, patch, and lozenge have been shown to be effective in highly dependent smokers. Also, there is evidence that combination NRT therapy may be particularly effective in suppressing tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Thus, it may be that NRT combinations are especially helpful to highly dependent smokers or those with a history of severe withdrawal. \\n\\tThere is evidence that NRT can be effective with both sexes; however, evidence is mixed as to whether NRT is less effective in women than men. This may encourage the clinician to consider use of another type of medication with women such as bupropion SR or varenicline. \\n\\tAs noted above, cessation medications have not been shown to be beneficial to light smokers. However, if NRT is used with light smokers, clinicians may consider reducing the dose of the medication. No adjustments are necessary when using bupropion SR or varenicline. \\n\\tConsider prescribing second-line agents (clonidine and nortriptyline) for patients unable to use first-line medications because of contraindications or for patients for whom the group of first-line medications has not been helpful. Assess patients for the specific contraindications, precautions, other concerns, and side effects of the second-line agents. Please refer to FDA package inserts for this information. \\n\\tData show that bupropion SR and nicotine replacement therapies, in particular 4 mg nicotine gum and 4 mg nicotine lozenge, delay, but do not prevent, weight gain. \\n\\tAre there medications that should be especially considered in patients with a past history of depression? \\n\\tBupropion SR and nortriptyline appear to be effective with this population, but nicotine replacement medications also appear to help individuals with a past history of depression. \\n\\tShould nicotine replacement therapies be avoided in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease? \\n\\tYes. This approach may be helpful with smokers who report persistent withdrawal symptoms during the course of medications, who have relapsed in the past after stopping, or who desire long-term therapy. A minority of individuals who successfully quit smoking use ad libitum NRT medications (gum, nasal spray, inhaler) long term. The use of these medications for up to 6 months does not present a known health risk and developing dependence on medications is uncommon. Additionally, the FDA has approved the use of bupropion SR, varenicline, and some NRT medications for 6-month use. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Yes. Patients frequently do not use cessation medications as recommended (e.g., they don\\'t use them at recommended doses or for recommended durations); this may reduce their effectiveness. \\n\\tYes. Among first-line medications, evidence exists that combining the nicotine patch long term (> 14 weeks) with nicotine gum or nicotine nasal spray, the nicotine patch with the nicotine inhaler, or the nicotine patch with bupropion SR, increases long-term abstinence rates relative to placebo treatments. \\n\\tInstruct the patient to set aside all the money they would have spent on tobacco once they quit. After initial use of medication they will be able to afford medication going forward. \\n\\tMany clinics that serve people with no health insurance will provide treatment for tobacco dependence, including medication. Check for ones in your area and have them available for staff and patients as a referral source. \\n\\tAs a clinician, you can call the tobacco quitline and ask about any sources of free or reduced cost medication for your patients. Try 1-800-QUIT-NOW, which works nationwide and seamlessly routes you to the quitline in the State you are calling from. \\n\\tIf your patient qualifies for Medicaid or Medicare, these programs cover some tobacco dependence treatment medications. Get this information for your State and have available for staff and patients. \\n\\tMost pharmaceutical companies have programs to provide medications to those who cannot afford them. Contact the pharmaceutical companies directly or check with Partnership for Prescription Assistance at www.pparx.org or 1-888-4PPA-NOW. \\n\\tTobacco dependence is an addiction. Quitting is very difficult for most tobacco users. It is essential that the patient trying to quit has scheduled followup. This is especially important when the treatment is shared by a team of clinicians and includes treatment extenders such as quitline counseling. \\xa0 \\n\\tTiming:  Followup contact should begin soon after the quit date, preferably during the first week. A second followup contact is recommended within the first month. Schedule further followup contacts as indicated. \\n\\tActions during followup contact : For all patients, identify problems already encountered and anticipate challenges in the immediate future. Assess medication use and problems. \\n\\tAsk, Advise, and Assess every tobacco user following the suggestions in  Tables 2-4 . If the patient is unwilling to make a quit attempt at this time, use the motivational strategies that follow to increase the likelihood of quitting in the future. \\n\\tTobacco users who do not want to quit now should be provided with specific interventions designed to increase the likelihood that they will decide to quit. This goal can be achieved through strategies designed to enhance motivation to quit. \\n\\tSuch interventions could incorporate the \"5 R\\'s\": Relevance, Risk, Rewards, Roadblocks, and Repetition. In these interventions, the clinician can introduce the topic of quitting but it is important that the tobacco users address each topic in their own words. The clinician can then help refine the patient\\'s responses and add to them as needed. \\xa0 \\n\\tEncourage the patient to indicate why quitting is personally relevant, being as specific as possible. Motivational information has the greatest impact if it is relevant to a patient\\'s disease status or risk, family or social situation (e.g., having children in the home), health concerns, age, gender, and other important patient characteristics (e.g., prior quitting experience, personal barriers to cessation). \\n\\tThe clinician should ask the patient to identify potential negative consequences of tobacco use. The clinician may suggest and highlight those that seem most relevant to the patient. The clinician should emphasize that smoking low-tar/low-nicotine cigarettes or use of other forms of tobacco (e.g., smokeless tobacco, cigars, and pipes) will not eliminate these risks. Examples of risks are: \\n\\tAcute risks: Shortness of breath, exacerbation of asthma or bronchitis, increased risk of respiratory infections, harm to pregnancy, impotence, infertility. \\n\\tLong-term risks: Heart attacks and strokes, lung and other cancers (e.g., larynx, oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, pancreas, stomach, kidney, bladder, cervix, and acute myelocytic leukemia), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (chronic bronchitis and emphysema), osteoporosis, long-term disability, and need for extended care. \\n\\tEnvironmental risks: Increased risk of lung cancer and heart disease in spouses; increased risk for low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), asthma, middle ear disease, and respiratory infections in children of smokers. \\n\\tThe clinician should ask the patient to identify potential benefits of stopping tobacco use. The clinician may suggest and highlight those that seem most relevant to the patient. Examples of rewards follow: \\n\\tThe clinician should ask the patient to identify barriers or impediments to quitting and provide treatment (problem-solving counseling, medication) that could address barriers. Typical barriers might include: \\n\\tThe motivational intervention should be repeated every time an unmotivated patient visits the clinic setting. Tobacco users who have failed in previous quit attempts should be told that most people make repeated quit attempts before they are successful and that you will continue to raise their tobacco use with them. \\n\\tInterventions to increase the likelihood that a tobacco user who does not want to quit will decide to quit can draw upon the principles of motivational interviewing: \\xa0 \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t The importance of addressing smoking or other tobacco use (e.g., \"How important do you think it is for you to quit?\"). \\n\\tSummarize (e.g., \"What I have heard so far is that smoking is something you enjoy. On the other hand, your boyfriend hates your smoking and you are worried you might develop a serious disease.\") \\n\\tSupport the patient\\'s autonomy and right to choose or reject change (e.g., \"I hear you saying you are not ready to quit smoking right now. I\\'m here to help you when you are ready.\") \\n\\tHighlight the discrepancy between the patient\\'s present behavior and expressed priorities, values, and goals (e.g., \"It sounds like you are very devoted to your family. How do you think your smoking is affecting your children and spouse/partner?”). \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \"So, you realize how smoking is affecting your breathing and making it hard to keep up with your kids.” \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \"There are effective treatments that will ease the pain of quitting, including counseling and many medication options. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \"Would you like to hear about some strategies that can help you address that concern when you quit?” \\n\\tMore than one motivational intervention may be required before the tobacco user who is unwilling to quit commits to a quit attempt. It is essential that the patient trying to quit has scheduled followup. Provide followup at the next visit and additional interventions to motivate and support the decisionmaking process of the patient who is unwilling to quit now. \\n\\tAsk  every patient at every visit if they use tobacco and his or her status documented clearly in the clinical record (e.g., as part of the vital signs, displayed prominently in the electronic medical record). (Go to  Table 2  for more details) \\xa0 \\n\\tMost relapse occurs within the first 2 weeks after the quit date and the risk decreases over time. Tobacco users who have quit very recently should be provided assistance. But the risk for relapse can persist for a long time for many tobacco users. Therefore, assess all former tobacco users, regardless of how long ago they quit, about challenges by asking the question below: \\n\\tThe former tobacco user should receive congratulations on any success and strong encouragement to remain abstinent \\n\\tWhen encountering a recent quitter, use open-ended questions relevant to the topics below to discover if the patient wishes to discuss issues related to quitting: \\n\\tAny success the patient has had in quitting (duration of abstinence, reduction in withdrawal, and so on). \\n\\tThe problems encountered or anticipated threats to maintaining abstinence (e.g., depression, weight gain, alcohol, other tobacco users in the household, significant stressors). \\n\\tIf significant, provide counseling, prescribe appropriate medication, or refer the patient to a specialist. \\n\\tIf the patient reports prolonged craving or other withdrawal symptoms, consider extending the use of an approved medication or adding/combining medications to reduce strong withdrawal symptoms. \\n\\tMaintain the patient on medication known to delay weight gain (e.g., bupropion SR, NRTs, particularly 4 mg nicotine gum, and lozenge). \\n\\tSuggest continued use of medications, which can reduce the likelihood that a lapse will lead to a full relapse. \\n\\tAll patients that have recently quit or still face challenges should receive followup for continued assistance and support. \\n\\t\\xa0 New Recommendations in the PHS-Sponsored Clinical Practice Guideline— Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update \\n\\tMost, but not all, of the new recommendations appearing in the 2008 Update of the Guideline resulted from new meta-analyses of the topics chosen by the Guideline panel. \\n\\tRecommendation : Tailored materials, both print and Web-based, appear to be effective in helping people quit. Therefore, clinicians may choose to provide tailored, self-help materials to their patients who want to quit. \\n\\tRecommendation : The combination of counseling and medication is more effective for smoking cessation than either medication or counseling alone. Therefore, whenever feasible and appropriate, both counseling and medication should be provided to patients trying to quit smoking. \\n\\tRecommendation : There is a strong relation between the number of sessions of counseling when it is combined with medication and the likelihood of successful smoking abstinence. Therefore, to the extent possible, clinicians should provide multiple counseling sessions, in addition to medication, to their patients who are trying to quit smoking. \\n\\tRecommendation : Motivational intervention techniques appear to be effective in increasing a patient\\'s likelihood of making a future quit attempt. Therefore, clinicians should use motivational techniques to encourage smokers who are not currently willing to quit to consider making a quit attempt in the future. \\n\\tRecommendation : The nicotine lozenge is an effective smoking cessation treatment that patients should be encouraged to use. \\n\\tNote: Go to the Guideline and  FDA Web site  for additional information on the safe and effective use of medication. \\n\\tRecommendation : Varenicline is an effective smoking cessation treatment that patients should be encouraged to use. \\n\\tNote: Go to the Guideline and the  FDA Web site  for additional information on the safe and effective use of medication. \\n\\tRecommendation : The interventions found to be effective in this Guideline have been shown to be effective in a variety of populations. In addition, many of the studies supporting these interventions comprised diverse samples of tobacco users. Therefore, interventions identified as effective in this Guideline are recommended for all individuals who use tobacco except when medically contraindicated or with specific populations in which medication has not been shown to be effective (pregnant women, smokeless tobacco users, light (<10 cigarettes/day) smokers, and adolescents). \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': \"As I prepare to travel to Seattle for AcademyHealth's 35th Annual Research Meeting (ARM), I have been thinking about the opportunity the meeting will afford to begin a critical dialog about the future of health services research (HSR). \\n\\tAs the Director of AHRQ, I have made it my mission to position the Agency to serve the American people in the rapidly shifting digital health care ecosystem and made it a call to action for my colleagues at AHRQ. If you have read my previous AHRQ Views blogs, you know that my vision is that state-of-the-art health services research should be transdisciplinary, data-driven, and should put patients at its center. \\n\\tTo envision the HSR field of tomorrow we need to probe three issues that I believe are critical to that future: \\n\\tFirst, how can we be more fully attuned to the research questions and the unmet needs of the entire health services delivery system? \\n\\tSecond, given the volume, variety, and velocity of the data being generated from and flowing into the health care ecosystem, what innovative opportunities do the vast array of new disruptive technology solutions, including blockchain, informatics, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, present for the research community? \\n\\tThird, what can we do to adopt a more holistic, trans-disciplinary, and person-360 approach to research? \\n\\tIt is important to take the next step and engage health system leaders—or as I like to call them, the operationalizers—in this conversation, and to ask how we can support health services research that improves both health care and the health of our Nation. We need to get these leaders involved early in helping us determine what questions they need answered to unlock their pain points, address their burning platforms, and fulfill their unmet needs for data. They also can guide us to understand the best way to deliver information to them in a way that is useful, operable, and sustainable. \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': 'In short, we as a health services research community need our users to help us understand how we can make a larger impact and help them make measureable improvements in the quality and safety of health and health care. \\n\\tI will start this dialog at AcademyHealth\\'s Annual Research Meeting with a session on Monday, June 25, titled, \"Moving Beyond p<0.05: Making Health Services Research Relevant to the C-Suite.\" The session will bring together C-Suite leaders to discuss how they think about data, social determinants of care, evidence, and research. \\n\\tWe want to learn how the C-Suite uses HSR and data, and what they will need in the future. In a nutshell, how do we in the world of HSR take stock of the changing landscape of the health care ecosystem, given the shifts in the industry, delivery systems, and mergers and acquisitions, as well as demographic, technological, and socioeconomic factors to recalibrate, reimagine, and redefine HSR. \\n\\tGiven these changes and trends in health and wellness, we need to ask how does the traditional health care-centric approach to HSR move towards a more transdisciplinary approach to research. For example, we need to explore how other disciplines such as informatics, social sciences, engineering, and business play a role in this new approach. \\n\\tAt the session, we also will ask audience members about their experiences providing research to the C-Suite and any lessons that they have learned. \\n\\tMy challenge to researchers and end users alike will be to think about how to make HSR more relevant in our ever-changing, digital world. As health care becomes increasingly complex, we must not only be relevant now, but we must also anticipate changes to remain relevant in the future. \\n\\tIf you are attending the ARM, keep my challenge in mind as you attend other sessions and talk to your colleagues at events throughout the meeting. It is an excellent topic of conversation for a coffee break or at a reception. \\n\\tAlso, I want to assure you that if you are not attending the ARM, this will not be the only time to participate in this dialog.

The program grew from two statewide primary care support organizations, Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) and the North Carolina Area Health Education Centers (AHEC). CCNC originated to promote the idea of medical homes for patients enrolled in Medicaid. It evolved into a public/private partnership working through the medical home model to support practice transformation and quality improvement. CCNC is organized as a regional network with a board in each region made up of patient, hospital, and practice representatives. The North Carolina AHECs are a regional network of health professionals that has provided extensive training on performance improvement and managed improvement programs. In 2006, formal efforts to align statewide primary care improvement efforts began with the formation of the NC Healthcare Quality Alliance. This initiative fostered partnerships between payers, provider organizations, and patient groups across the State and helped to catalyze efforts, including the regional extension center and Medicaid payment reform. \\n\\t\",\n",

To date, most efforts to reduce hospital readmissions have been hospital-focused, but primary care practices also have a key role in preventing avoidable readmissions. From April 2012 to September 2013, nine North Carolina primary care practices participated in a Web-based learning collaborative focused on improving care transitions.

Nearly 30 percent of Americans report unhealthy alcohol use, which refers to the full spectrum of alcohol misuse, including risky or hazardous drinking, harmful drinking, alcohol abuse, and alcohol use disorder. \\n\\tThe  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force  recommends that clinicians routinely screen adults for unhealthy alcohol use and provide behavioral counseling to people who engage in risky or hazardous drinking. But among those diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, only about 7 percent of adults receive any type of treatment. \\n\\tThe time to address the problem is now. Clinicians, researchers, public health officials, and others must work together to help people avoid or stop the unhealthy use of alcohol. \\n\\tBecause primary care clinicians are the most likely to first see patients engaged in unhealthy alcohol use, AHRQ has released a new  Funding Opportunity Announcement  (FOA) to fund research that can help primary care clinicians improve screening and treatment for unhealthy alcohol use. AHRQ plans to invest up to $13.5 million over 3 years to support up to six awards. \\n\\tAHRQ’s new FOA seeks applications from grantees who propose a variety of strategies to increase the dissemination and implementation of research findings for identifying and managing unhealthy alcohol use. Applicants are expected to focus their proposals on screening and behavioral interventions (SBI) and medication-assisted treatment (MAT). \\n\\tAHRQ’s new funding announcement follows previous work by the Agency to support primary care clinicians and their efforts to help patients struggling with alcohol. A  research review  released in 2016 was the basis for two publications—one for  clinicians  one for  patients —designed to increase shared decisionmaking and make the best use of evidence in treating alcohol use disorder. \\n\\tOur expectations are high that AHRQ’s new grants will lead to significant progress. The negative impacts of untreated unhealthy alcohol use—on patients, their families, and their communities—can be devastating. These consequences are powerful incentives for us to work together and increase the use of evidence to tackle this urgent public health concern. \\n\\tWe look forward to your research applications, which are due on January 4, 2019.

States also can use web-based learning sessions to supplement or replace in-person meetings to make attendance easier, especially for practices in rural or frontier communities. \\n\\tWith encouragement from the State, practices used a self-administered assessment of medical homeness that tracked changes over time and helped focus QI activities on areas most in need of attention. \\n\\tMost practices lack the technical competencies to gather the data needed to implement and track practice-level QI efforts. Although learning collaboratives can help build providers’ capacity, not all practices want to improve data collection and measurement skills; some view the burden of data collection and measurement activities as outweighing the benefits. \\n\\tSome States hired practice facilitators (sometimes called QI specialists or coaches) to help practices and SBHCs develop QI teams, identify and undertake QI activities, and collect and analyze data to track progress. To be effective, practice facilitators need to: (1) possess strong interpersonal skills that support practice engagement; (2) have technical knowledge in quality measurement, QI strategies, and clinical content areas; and (3) have caseloads that permit them to spend sufficient time with a practice or SBHC. \\n\\t',\n",

It is constantly evolving; if you get one thing going, there is always something else you can tweak or improve upon.” 11  A paper by Solberg et al found substantial variation in the performance of PCMHs and that many had significant room for improvement. This indicated to the investigators that there is a continuum of transformation and performance among medical homes, even after they have achieved recognition. 12 \\n\\t',\n",

Solberg reported that the Practice Advisory Group for 120 health care homes in Minnesota realized only after they had been certified as a PCMH for a while that becoming certified was “just the start of the journey” (oral interview, December 2014), and that successful transformation required not just meeting recognition standards, but rather a change in overall practice culture. Most of the TPC PIs agreed that “a practice could be a true PCMH without having received recognition, and a practice that has received recognition may not be a true PCMH.” 1  However, the standards that are required for PCMH recognition, particularly those of NCQA, have evolved over time to encompass important elements of practice transformation that were not included in earlier versions. \\n\\t',\n",

However, the State was unable to report on all 26 measures due to the limited availability of administrative data on behavioral health services and clinical data from practices’ EHRs. \\n\\t',\n",

Rather than setting expectations they cannot meet, clinicians need to accept that this is a role better filled by others and help their patients connect with the outside resources they need. \\n\\tHealth plans, medical groups, and physician practices can play two important roles to counter this problem. First, they can manage the expectations of members and patients by helping them regard their doctors as coaches rather than all-knowing sages.

Tactics for providing this support include self-care programs and support groups. \\n\\tSelf-Care Programs:  Self-care programs are usually highly structured educational forums where patients with a chronic condition may learn about a variety of topics, including symptom management, nutrition, community resources, medications, managing emotions, and communication skills. 1 , 2  Self-care programs often teach skills that make people better able to manage their medical problems on their own, e.g., taking a blood pressure, giving injections, taking medications, and even performing diagnostic tests such as urine tests and blood glucose.

Welcome to the first recording in the Cohort 9ED Educational Webinar Series. Today's webinar topic is ED Physician Engagement. \\n\\tFor Cohort Education we are using these recorded mini webinars to bring important concepts and education to you, the frontline staff, so that you may learn together as an ED team. Please gather your team around and spend the next 15 to 20 minutes learning about CAUTI prevention together. \\n\\tAt the end of today's presentation there are a few discussion questions that we ask you to talk about as a group before joining the March 3 ED coaching call hosted by the New Jersey Hospital Association. During the March 3 coaching call all ED teams will be invited to share the outcomes of their discussion. It's a great opportunity for peer learning and we are excited to hear from all of you. \\n\\tToday's presenter is Dr. Margarita Pena. Dr. Pena is an emergency physician at St. John's Hospital, the medical director of the observation unit and the associate program director of the Emergency Medicine Residency Program. She is also a clinical associate professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Wayne State University Schools of Medicine. \\n\\tDr. Pena has worked with Dr. Mohammed Fakih on preventing CAUTI as the ED physician champion since 2007 and has since published four papers with Dr. Fakih on CAUTI in the ED. I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Dr. Pena. \\n\\tMargarita: Thank you. It is a pleasure to share with you our experience and success with reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use in the emergency department. I hope that you can take away some helpful information to assist your facility in this important endeavor and that this presentation generates some further discussion points. \\n\\tWhy is it important that efforts to reduce CAUTI include the emergency department? Well, since about 50% of patients that are admitted to the hospital come through the emergency department, it is important that efforts to reduce CAUTI include the emergency department. \\n\\tFurthermore, a catheter that's placed in the ED is much more likely to be removed once the patient is dmitted. In order to accomplish this it's important to change the culture of urinary catheter placement in the emergency department. This involves heavy buy-in from all the ED staff, from the physicians to the nurses to the techs. \\n\\tThis presentation is mainly going to focus on the physician piece. Through our work we found that there are three steps, three keys to success that are required to change culture in the emergency department. The first is to establish a collaborative guideline for ED catheter placement. The second is to involve physicians and obtain their buy-in. The third is to recheck, revise and to review. \\n\\tIn order to successfully establish ED urinary guidelines you need to first identify an ED physician champion. This champion will serve to collaborate with infection control and inform and educate the ED physician staff. In this manner, indication for urinary catheter use has easy input to identify any indications beyond the CDC HICPAC guidelines that may be unique to emergency department. \\n\\tAfter discussion, any new ED indications for UC placements can be mutually agreed upon and clearly identified and then added to any hospital specific guidelines. In our institution, Dr. Fakih is the infectious disease specialist that leads this effort with whom I've collaborated with. \\n\\tIn the second step, which is physician engagement, this is a crucial step in ensuring success. We accomplish this in a multi-prong manner. I first presented this during our physician department meeting. I talked about CAUTI and the importance of decreasing urinary catheter placement in the emergency department and then I presented a draft of the guidelines. \\n\\tDr. Fakih was also invited. All the comments and the feedback regarding content and the wording were discussed, any changes made and then agreed upon. The final draft of the guidelines were then distributed to all the ED physician and resident staff during subsequent department meetings and lectures. We also placed to guidelines on pocket cards for easy reference. These were distributed to physician and the nursing staff. \\n\\tThis is an example actually of our final guidelines that we have and it includes changes that we actually made to our initial guidelines. A study in 2010 that we published after first instituting our initial guidelines we found that catheter placement was appropriately indicated in about 75% of the patients if they had a documented physician order. \\n\\tOnly about 50% of urinary catheters had a physician order documented. Furthermore, patients without a physician order only 52% were appropriately indicated. This is the reason why we highlighted the phrase, “Always obtain a physician order before placing a urinary catheter”. This is why we felt it necessary to place it both in the front and in the back of the cards. \\n\\tThe final step to ensuring success is to recheck regularly for compliance. Identify any reasons for noncompliance and then identify opportunities. For example, we found that because we are a teaching hospital and we have emergency medicine residents who write many of the patient orders it was very important to have their buy-in. \\n\\tWe identified a resident physician champion who then presented information and educated his peers about reducing urinary catheter use in the emergency department similarly to what I had done. You may also find it necessary to revise the guidelines. For example, we did revise the guidelines for patients that are requiring [inaudible 00:05:52] catheter for acute mental status changes with agitation. We found that this was not necessary. Actually, this was a requirement that was easily conformed to. \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': \"The second was to work with radiology and collaborate with them and find that we really did not need a urinary catheter for emergency pelvic ultrasound and this could only be used on a patient-by-patient basis. Finally, you want to review your guidelines periodically with all your emergency department staff. This regular feedback as well as information will assure that the information is processed and placed through all the appropriate ED staff, including any new staff members. \\n\\tIn our 2010 study, we did find the physician ordered about 40% less urinary catheters after these processes were placed. This translated to urinary catheter utilization for emergency department admitted patients to only about 10%. This process did work and you can do it too using the three-step method. \\n\\tNumber one, to summarize, finding collaborative guidelines using both emergency department and infection disease champions. Number two, ensuring physician buy-in. Number three, the three Rs, which is re recheck, to revise, and to review, and this will ensure your success. \\n\\tSome other discussion questions that I think will be important with bringing this information to your institution are, number one, do you already have an ED attending physician champion? Number two, what is the greatest barrier that you anticipate in establishing this project? Number three, what successful methods have you used in the past to ensure physician buy-in of clinical processes? \\n\\tJanine:\\xa0Thank you, Dr. Pena, I really appreciate your time and expertise on this matter. As Dr. Pena mentioned, the discussion questions on the screen right now are the discussion question we would like for you to take back to your ED team and discuss before joining the March 3 CAUTI coaching call. We hope that'll have a lot of peer-to-peer learning and sharing amongst the team members who are on the call about what they're doing to engage physician champions in their emergency department. \\n\\tThank you very much for your time and attention today and just a reminder that your feedback is very important to us. If you please take a moment to fill out an evaluation of today's webinar. The link is on the screen here but then you can also receive it through your state lead in the communication they sent about this recording. \\n\\tWe hope you'll join us for the upcoming March 3 ED coaching call at 2:00 pm eastern, where Dr. Pena will be available to answer any questions you may have from today's webinar.

       " {'text': 'In Module 1, we discussed the indications for an indwelling urinary catheter, the causes of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, or CAUTI, in the intensive care unit, or ICU, as well as methods to mitigate the risk of CAUTI. In Module 2, you learned about the importance of observation and communication, both about placing the urinary catheter bag and using a securement device. \\n\\tIn this module, we will look at a case scenario involving communication between a day nurse and a night nurse. \\n\\tThis ICU had a high urinary catheter utilization rate that might have contributed to high CAUTI rates. Three months ago, the ICU implemented a nurse-driven indwelling catheter removal protocol, which included removing catheters that met criteria defined in the protocol. This was a major change for the nursing staff. \\n\\tSally identified that Ms. X, a patient on a ventilator, no longer required a urinary catheter. She implemented the nurse-driven protocol because there was no need for hourly output measurement. In addition, the patient was awake, alert, and able to void using a female urinal or bedpan. Sally noted that the patient was on a chronic diuretic, but it was not being adjusted. She removed the catheter according to the protocol, with no exceptions noted, after discussing solutions with the team. In case the patient developed incontinence, Sally placed an absorbent pad under Ms. X and instructed her on how to call the nurse when the bedpan was needed. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Pause the presentation and think: Was this the right decision? What elements of the situation led Sally to make her decision? \\n\\tThird, although Ms. X was on a chronic diuretic, which would lead to high urinary output, it was not being adjusted. \\n\\tThat night, Molly arrived for the night shift. Molly was an experienced nurse and had worked in the ICU for 15 years. When conducting her patient rounds, she found Ms. X was incontinent. The urine had soaked through the pad, onto the bed, and even on her stockings. Shortly after the bed was changed, Ms. X was incontinent again. Molly was very upset. \\n\\tMolly: I can’t believe you pulled the catheter on Ms. X. She was incontinent all night, and I’m afraid her skin will break down. What were you thinking? \\n\\tSally: I was following the nurse-driven protocol, and she didn’t meet criteria for continued catheter use. I put a pad under her and instructed her on how to ring for the bedpan. \\n\\tMolly: I think you better brush up on your nursing skills because that showed a complete disregard for patient dignity. I’m reporting this to management. \\n\\tSally: I’m sorry you had such a difficult night, but I did run the situation by the team and they all agreed with my decision. Sounds like we need to talk this over with our manager. \\n\\tThink back to the points we discussed about Sally’s decision. Did you agree with her? Was she right to remove the catheter? What other actions might Sally have taken? Was Molly’s behavior appropriate? What might the manager do to mitigate this situation? \\n\\tPause the presentation and think about these questions. Once you’ve considered them, resume playing the presentation. \\n\\tNurses are busy, and for many nurses, removing a catheter is a change in practice. Clearly, Ms. X met criteria for removal according to the protocol. Although these are difficult decisions, it is important to keep the overall goal in mind. Continued use of an indwelling catheter can lead to a CAUTI which may also result in bacteremia and sepsis.\\xa0 In addition, antibiotic treatment for the CAUTI can put the patient at risk for multiple drug-resistant organisms or  Clostridium difficile . \\n\\tSally could have communicated better. In the handoff between shifts, Sally could have reported to the night staff that the catheter was removed during the day because Ms. X no longer met criteria for continuation of the urinary catheter. Additionally, she could have shared the alternative strategies that she put in place, which were use of the bedpan and absorbent pads.\\xa0 \\n\\tAdditional interventions may have included offering the bedpan or female urinal at scheduled intervals. \\n\\tNo. Although Molly’s concern for patient dignity was well-meaning, Sally’s decision followed department protocol. Change in practice can be difficult, so this situation was an opportunity for staff to discuss the plan of care. \\n\\tJanet, the manager, should take the opportunity to talk with Molly about the situation and make some recommendations. \\n\\tJanet: I completely understand your position. But, would you agree that patient safety is our highest priority? \\n\\tJanet: Well, our indwelling catheter utilization rate has historically been in the 90th percentile as compared with similar type ICUs. Would you agree that’s pretty high? \\n\\tJanet: I do, too. However in the last 3 months, since we initiated the nurse-driven protocol, it’s dropped to the 50th percentile. \\n\\tJanet: I know we have more opportunities for improvement, and there may be times when the catheter has to be reinserted, but every patient who meets the criteria deserves that chance. You are an important part of this process. \\n\\tI tell you what. How about you and some of the other personnel develop a communication tool so that changes in catheter use and alternative approaches are communicated clearly between shifts? \\n\\tWe started off by looking at a scenario that dealt with the decision process for whether to remove a urinary catheter. Next, we learned the importance of good communication related to catheter removal. In our scenario, Molly raised valid concerns regarding patient dignity.\\xa0 However, Sally’s decision to remove the catheter was based on a unit protocol which optimizes patient safety.\\xa0 It is also important to remember that catheter removal can improve a patient’s comfort and mobility, thereby also contributing to patient dignity. \\n\\t',\n",

The new report indicates, for example, that rates of acute renal failure, shock, mechanical ventilation use and sepsis at delivery all more than doubled during the 10-year period. \\n\\t“This report provides an essential update to our understanding of an urgent public health issue,” said AHRQ Director Gopal Khanna, M.B.A. “With these data in hand, State and Federal agencies, patient safety experts and health systems can evaluate maternal morbidity trends in greater depth, a vital step before addressing the challenge.” \\n\\tAHRQ’s new statistical brief, “ Trends and Disparities in Delivery Hospitalizations Involving Severe Maternal Morbidity, 2006-2015 ,”  provides detailed statistics on complications involving labor and delivery: \\n\\tThe rate of severe complications increased 45 percent overall during a 10-year period, from 101 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations in 2006 to 147 per 10,000 in 2015. \\n\\tSome severe conditions involved medical procedures. In 2015, for example, blood transfusions occurred with more than half of deliveries among mothers who were in shock, had an amniotic fluid embolism, were experiencing a sickle cell disease crisis or had disseminated intravascular coagulation (the formation of blood clots throughout the body). One-third of deliveries with shock had a hysterectomy. \\n\\tIn 2015, rates of severe maternal morbidity were highest among poor mothers, for those over the age of 40, or uninsured\\xa0or on Medicaid or lived in large urban areas. \\n\\tThe report also underscored racial and ethnic disparities among women who experienced severe complications. For example, although deaths decreased overall, black women were three times more likely than white women to die as a result of delivering a baby in 2015 (11 versus 4 deaths per 100,000 delivery hospitalizations, respectively). Compared with white women, severe maternal morbidity was 110 percent more likely among black women, 40 percent more likely among Hispanic women and 20 percent more likely among Asian/Pacific Islander women in 2015. \\n\\t',\n",

It was established by the Affordable Care Act, and the goals that were mandated by Congress were to improve the delivery of health care services, patient health outcomes, and population health. So, it's a broad challenge for us all. We first published in 2011, and we really see this as a nationwide effort. It's something that HHS was given the lead for, but it's not a federal government strategy and it's not simply a private sector strategy. It's all of us together. And it was really designed iteratively by public and private stakeholders with a lot of input and back and forth. \\n\\t\",\n",

Well, if you look at this slide and you are familiar with the Triple Aim and then you look over at the National Quality Strategy, you should see some similarities here. The National Quality Strategy's aims really resemble the IHI and build, purposely build, on the work that IHI has done, you know, in groundbreaking work in the 90s. I think that some of the emphasis that we try to elaborate on was focusing on the total experience of better care in addition to patients and patient experience. And when we talk about improving the health of populations, we really wanted to expand on the idea of healthy communities at different levels. Same with affordability. We wanted to focus on more than the affordability for the society as a whole, but really thinking about individuals and families in addition to society. \\n\\t\",\n",

And we see these priorities as reflecting the concerns that affect most Americans — patient safety, person– and family-centered care, effective communication, and care coordination, prevention and treatment of leading causes of morbidity and mortality the well-being of communities, and making care more affordable. So, I can't say that enough. We see these as cross-cutting issues that are very important.

Going from there to value-purchasing is the single most important thing that purchasers can do. It's putting our money where our mouth is. And I'm pleased to say that after 25 years of just a few pioneer companies, union funds, business groups I've helped, there's now a widespread belief among private purchasers that this the way to go, that is value purchasing. \\n\\t\",\n",

And we're still in the first generation of modest, quality programs, and it's not enough to get the job done that we need to do. \\n\\tGerry Shea: \\xa0Our measures are getting better and better, and we're producing a lot more measures than we've ever had. But, unfortunately, there's been a paradigm developed in, as I've watched over the past few years, that build it and they will come. In other words, once we have – next year we'll have the best set of measures and then everybody will, you know, rally behind those, and we won't have this proliferation of many different kinds of measures. And I want to say to you today, just conceptually, that is the wrong way to look at the job ahead of us. We need to both work on getting better and better measures, and work on aligning those measures because the problem today of poor alignment is really swamping a lot of our resources. \\n\\t\",\n",

And then we're going to get some data later this spring from a national study that I'm told replicates that small sample. And this has to be – for private purchasers to get value purchasing, it has to be a virtual plug-and-play process. The garden-variety employer or union fund simply doesn't have the resources to figure out the quality landscape and determine their own measures, nor should they. We should all be following common measure sets.

Our objective is to have widespread adoption of value purchasing. \\n\\tOur strategy has been two-fold. And this is speaking over the last two years. One is a measure alignment campaign. We've been doing both research and discussion about how could we come to agreement, consensus; how can we reach consensus on core measure sets that everybody could use?

And that led us to discover just how poor the alignment is among states, between states and national programs, and even within the state. \\n\\tSo, we then moved on and we developed a model for how to develop consensus core measure sets that operate at the national level and then the state, local, or regional level. So, there would be two complementary sets of core measures, actually many core measure sets because you need them for different clinical areas and so forth. But you'd have national consensus on core measure sets, and that would be supplemented; not replaced but supplemented at the regional, state or local level. And paper on this model is available on our website. And then the last thing we did was we developed an online measure selection tool, which is the practical help for state and local programs. \\n\\t\",\n",

When you get a group of people together around the table, any place in the country you're going to get different opinions of what are the best measures in a particular area.

Well, thank you very much and good afternoon, everybody. I'm going to take the next few minutes to talk with you about the alternative quality contract or AQC, which is a payment model that we developed at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts in 2007 and launched in 2009. \\n\\tSo, I'll cover three broad categories over the next few minutes. First is some context about why we decided to develop this model and how the model works; second is what the results have been; and third is, given this audience and the topic, I thought you'd be interested to hear a little bit about perspectives on the model and our next steps. \\n\\tThe Alternative Quality Contract: Twin goals of improving quality and slowing spending growth [Slide 26] \\n\\tDana Safran: \\xa0This will help with a bit of the context. In 2007, why was it, before there was any significant conversation locally in Massachusetts or nationally about payment reform, that Blue Cross of Massachusetts set out to develop a global budget on quality contract model? And the answer is we were in the early months of implementing our now quite famous coverage reform law and knew that as we began to have individuals participating in large numbers, buying insurance for themselves because the state law said they had to have it, and they didn't have a way to receive it through an employer or public program--individuals would, for the first time really, be coming face-to-face with the significant rate of growth in health care spending and how that so far exceeded the rest of the economic growth. \\n\\t\",\n",

The blue trend line that you see there is the real live Blue Cross of Massachusetts medical expense trend over that time period from 2000 to 2009. So, you can see, as we were sitting there in 2007, looking back, there were double digit increases in medical spending every single year. And that\\'s contrasted with the green line, which is general economic growth, and the red line, which is growth in worker\\'s earnings. \\n\\tSo, we knew this was going to become a very public issue and we set about to develop a model that would accomplish what we called our twin goals of significantly improving quality while at the same time significantly slowing the rate of spending growth; in fact, to have spending growth that would look more like the rest of the economy. And our CEO at the time put it this way, he said, \"We spend about $13 billion a year on claims. I\\'m not looking to take money out of the system, but I am looking to get more for what we buy and to significantly slow the rate of growth on that $13 billion.\" So, those were our twin goals. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': \"Dana Safran: \\xa0This is an overview of some of the things that are distinct about the AQC model from our traditional contract models. So, first and probably most importantly, is that a provider organization that comes into an AQC contract agrees to be accountable for a patient population over time. And for all the care received across all settings from pre-natal care to end-of-life care, the cost and quality of outcomes of that care become their accountability. \\n\\tNow, just to underscore how different that is from a provider's accountability under a traditional fee-for-service contract, that provider in a fee-for-service contract is accountable for the patient in front of them for as long as that visit or hospital stay or encounter lasts. And their accountability is done when the visit is over until and unless the patient returns. So, accountability across time and space for a whole population is a dramatically different proposition. \\n\\tWe also, as you can see, establish a global budget for that patient population. Very importantly, the model builds that budget specific to each provider organization based on the historic rate of spending for their population. So, why is that important? Well, both from a provider adoption perspective, but also a public acceptance perspective, we felt it was absolutely critical in a model that was going to try to find waste and get waste out of healthcare spending to start providers off with the same amount of resources they had had under the fee-for-service system, but now have them have incentives to find where could there be waste and to share in the savings if they did find that waste. \\n\\t\",\n",

But maybe more importantly, a public that today unfortunately still is very concerned that any bit of health care held back from them and as something that could cause harm would have been extremely suspicious of the model. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': \"So, it's very important to have this feature where baseline budgets were set based on historic spending. As you can see, it's a two-sided risk model that providers share in savings, but also in deficits if they overspend their budget in a given year. And trend targets, very importantly, are set at the beginning before the contract is signed for each year over the five-year contract. And why this is important is so that the provider knows how much their budget is going to grow in year two, in year three, in year four, and in year five. And to have this be known and to have it be limited so that, unlike the medical trends we were looking at in the previous slide, we actually begin to control cost growth and do it in a way that's transparent and known to the providers who are accepting this accountability. \\n\\t\",\n",

All of these are NQF, nationally endorsed, accepted measures. \\n\\tOne of the important innovations that we made was to have the performance target include a range of scores, not just the single number. And that's really transformed providers' motivation and the way that they engage with a pay-for-performance type of model because it laid out for them essentially an agenda for improvement over the five-year contract because for every measure, there is a range of performance targets that represent good to exceptionally good care.

As much as 80 percent if you're at the only at the beginning of good quality. And if you're in a surplus, you get to keep up to 80 percent of the surplus if you're at the best possible quality.

After this, I'll share with you about the cost results. This is, of course, the subset of the quality measures. What you're looking at here are a composite of the adult chronic care process measures. In the middle, a composite of pediatric acute and preventive care measures, and on the right, a composite of adult clinical outcome measures dealing with good control of serious chronic illnesses.

And for this cohort that I\\'m picturing here, 2009 was the launch of the contract. \\n\\tSo, significant improvements all along the way. A somewhat different story for the different types of measures. You can see in pediatrics, the providers were already well above the national average, but continued to gain. I think the most important and key accomplishment here is reflected in the right side because it was audacious for Blue Cross of Mass in 2008 as we negotiated these contracts to ask providers to become accountable, not just for process, not just for patient experience, but for the actual clinical outcomes that they were achieving. There was nobody else who was doing that at the time. And frankly, I thought, as a measurement scientist for my whole career, that they would say, \"These are all valid measures. We like the NQF endorsement, but you must be kidding me if you think we\\'ll be accountable for what happens when the patient is out of our view.\" \\n\\t',\n",

And you can see the significant accomplishment, where before the AQC contract began they were running right about where the national average was with only about 62 percent of adults with chronic illness being under good control to where now 74 percent are under good control. \\n\\tNow, just to underscore that, that\\'s not, you know, for one disease, or one measure, or one medical group. This is across all of our 2009 contracts, which is about 25 percent of our network for all adult chronic illnesses that we measure in this contract. And what you also notice is, nationally, this number just hasn\\'t budged. It is hard to change outcomes. You really have to engage differently with patients. \\n\\tDana Safran: \\xa0So, on this slide here, what I\\'m showing you are the results published by the Harvard Medical School team led by Dr. Michael Chernew that has been doing a longitudinal evaluation of the AQC. The four-year results were published late in 2014 in the New England Journal of Medicine. And what they found was consistent with some of the earlier findings that the AQC, right from year one, was driving reduced medical spending. And what in particular they found is that the ability to achieve savings over the control group, savings over what is otherwise happening in the environment, has been accelerating over time. So, about 2 percent in the first year, and about 3 percent in the second year, and then up to 6 percent, and then up to about 10 percent by year four. \\n\\t',\n",

You make more money if you do more things. So, turning that ship and beginning to behave differently was a significant change for providers.

Dana, I'm going to shift things a little bit and share one of the first questions that came in for you, which is can you give a brief explanation of what you mean by triple weighting the scores. \\n\\tDana Safran: \\xa0Oh, absolutely. So, as I mentioned, there are 64 measures in total. So, if you imagine each of those measures kind of having a weight of one. The clinical outcome measures on the ambulatory side count three times. \\n\\tNancy Wilson: \\xa0One other one that I'm going to give you is did the populations that you served include Medicaid? \\n\\tDana Safran: \\xa0No. They did not include Medicaid. We do, however-this is probably a very important point for this audience. We have done some very interesting analyses related to what happened with quality for providers in the AQC who do serve a disproportionately low socioeconomic status population. And one of the really encouraging findings here is that two of our provider organizations who serve the lowest socioeconomic status mix, the most vulnerable population, achieved some of the biggest quality gains and the highest quality scores since starting this contract. And why is it important is that we made the decision to adjust the budgets for the population being served, but hold the same performance standards for everybody on the quality scores because I just could not in my own mind feel comfortable saying I'm going to set a lower standard of care for patients who go to a provider that serves a socioeconomic status population. \\n\\t\",\n",

What does it mean to get to your highest levels of performance on these measures given that I have a population that looks like this? And seeing them not only succeed but actually close disparities in care that have existed for so long and now have a population that has better quality scores than some of the advantaged populations, I think, is a very important victory. \\n\\tGerry Shea: \\xa0The first challenge is creating it. So you have to have agreement on what the core measure set would be. And then the second step is to actually go to all the stakeholders and see if they\\'ll sign on to use that core measure set. So, in a particular state, you would go to the various health systems, and very importantly to the payers, the insurers, to see if they will accept that measure set. Understanding that to go from an existing set of measures to a different set of measures does take a transition period. There\\'s just no way around that. But we envision the day when you could say, for instance, to, you know, your garden-variety employer or union fund, \"Here\\'s the core set of measures. It\\'s being used by Medicare. It\\'s being used by the big private payers. It\\'s being used by the health plans. This is what you should expect will happen when you buy health care.\" \\n\\t',\n",

Did you measure enrollee satisfaction with care? And did that also improve? That's one question. And then sort of along those lines, were there any provider's surveys that you conducted, including downstream subcontractors who may have been impacted by the change in the payment structure — folks like pharmacy, durable medical equipment specialist, hospital contracts?

We use a version of the Clinician and Group-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG-CAHPS) tool on the ambulatory side. On the hospital side we use HCAHPS. And not all measures – we – I think on hospital CAHPS there are four that are very clinically relevant and for which most respondents do screen in. So, we have enough data to measure with– good reliability. \\n\\tOn the ambulatory side, for those not familiar with CG-CAHPS, that's a tool that is measuring patient's experiences with their primary care physician and that physician's practice. And there are four ambulatory adult patient experience measures and four ambulatory pediatric patient experience measures, so eight in total. So, they carry quite a lot of weight actually in the overall measure set. \\n\\tAnd I think, you know, I didn't say this explicitly before. The quality measure set plays a very important role as a backstop against any impulse that providers would have to provide too little care or (same time) care in a budgeted model. Patient experience measures are really important to that because that's one of the ways that we would know if patients were really starting to experience something in the care setting that was looking unfavorable. \\n\\tWhat we've seen is quite significant improvement in patient experience. And if we had the data that would allow us to look at the subgroup that has chronic illnesses, our suspicion is that we would see their scores kind of off the charts because these are the patients who, you know — what we hear from them anecdotally — feel like they've landed in a concierge practice because suddenly, you know, the doctor's office is reaching out to them in between visits to find out how they're doing, how they're managing with their medicine, with their, the other lifestyle changes that they need to make to keep their condition under good control. \\n\\t\",\n",

We do surveys of our primary care providers and those actually have improved pretty significantly, too, because almost every AQC group, if not every AQC group, is using a significant share of the incentive dollars that they're paid to reward primary care practices building infrastructure and to reward primary care clinicians because so much of the success and the model relies on primary care. \\n\\tNancy Wilson: \\xa0Thank you so much. One quick question because we're running out of time is around what was the payment frequency to the physician for the incentives? \\n\\tDana Safran: \\xa0So, again, we're paying the organization.

This carefully curated online collection of more than 100 tools and resources can help primary care practices in their ongoing efforts to improve quality by providing evidence-based care to their patients. \\n\\tThe Tools for Change resource is one important outgrowth of AHRQ’s  EvidenceNow  initiative, a project launched in 2015 that used  practice facilitators  (practice improvement coaches) to work with more than 1,500 small- and medium-sized primary care practices nationwide. \\n\\tHere’s one example of the initiative’s impact: Research shows that smokers who get counseling from their doctors are twice as likely to quit as those who don’t. With that evidence in mind, and with assistance from EvidenceNow, a small practice in Oregon changed its electronic health records to track how many smokers got counseling. Using that data to drive improvement, the practice increased the percentage of smokers counseled from 12 percent to 70 percent! \\n\\tAHRQ has learned a great deal from EvidenceNOW about what it takes for practices to make that kind of improvement. In order to share what has been learned with everyone, we teamed up with the  EvidenceNOW cooperatives  and  national evaluators , as well as the practice facilitators who directly coached EvidenceNOW practices, to develop a quality improvement framework. The framework—the  EvidenceNOW Key Driver Diagram —consists of the following six big changes (i.e., key drivers) that practices need to make to increase their capacity to use evidence. \\n\\t',\n",

The journey began with efforts to identify hazards through an incident reporting system called the Intensive Care Unit Safety Reporting System. We quickly found that identifying hazards was merely a first step. We also needed to investigate and learn from these hazards to prevent patient harm. Therefore, we developed the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) to identify and learn from local defects and improve teamwork and safety culture. Teams across many units faced common problems, such as healthcare-acquired infections, for which there is empiric evidence on prevention practices, but the evidence is unreliably applied. This discovery led us to develop a model to translate research into practice (TRIP). We combined TRIP with CUSP for the Keystone ICU Project design, with the goal of improving care for adult patients in Michigan intensive care units (ICUs). The resulting dramatic and sustained reductions in central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in Michigan led to a national initiative to reduce CLABSIs across the United States. Applying the perspectives from different academic disciplines helped us learn how this national effort succeeded, an approach we also used to study cardiac surgery-related errors. Still, the CLABSI effort addressed one type of harm, while patients are at risk for over a dozen and care systems relying more on the heroism of clinicians than on safe design. Current efforts include building a quality management infrastructure to support improvement work and defining the skills, resources, and accountability needed at every level of a health system. We are also partnering with patients, their loved ones, and others to eliminate all harms, optimize patient experience and outcomes, and reduce waste. In this trans-disciplinary systems approach, we hope to reduce all harms, improve productivity, and enhance joy for clinicians. \\n\\t',\n",

These insights led to the creation of the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP). \\n\\tOur work in ICUs helped us realize that culture is an integral part of safety and quality improvement.

We already had a checklist to coordinate and effectively communicate a patient's daily goals during rounds. This checklist was developed in 2001, when an ICU attending physician (PJP) realized that only 10 percent of the nurses or physicians in an adult surgical ICU at JHH understood the goals for their patients at the end of rounds. The checklist was pilot tested in the same ICU, increasing nurse and physician comprehension of daily patient goals to 95 percent. 15  The daily goals checklist became a repository for some safety practices.

Five of the checklist practices related to catheter insertion (wash hands, clean patient skin with chlorhexidine, use full barrier precautions during insertion, avoid femoral vein site, maintain sterile field during insertion), and one described catheter maintenance. \\n\\tDespite knowledge and a desire to comply with the checklist, physicians faced a major barrier—lack of necessary supplies. We followed the principles of safe design (part of the CUSP training in the science of safety) and created the line cart because clinicians in our surgical ICU had to gather catheter insertion supplies from eight places to comply with the practices. The cart increased checklist compliance rates from 30 percent to 75 percent, but we were still far from 100 percent. Infection rates were cut in half. Therefore, we compiled a checklist of these best practices, which standardized the insertion process and offered an independent check by the bedside nurse to ensure that physicians complied with these practices. When nurses piloted the checklist, physicians resisted being questioned about their practices and often ignored nurses (a warning that to improve safety we must also improve culture). Therefore, we educated all staff about the consequences of suboptimal practices. We empowered nurses to stop non-emergent procedures if a practice was ignored and instructed them to page the ICU attending physician if a resident was noncompliant. With the nursing intervention, compliance increased from 75 percent to 95 percent, and infection rates fell further. Finally, ICU and infection prevention staff investigated every infection as a defect, using a modified version of the original learning from defects tool, 23  to identify ways to prevent the infection. The success of the overall intervention shifted health care from the philosophy that bloodstream infections were inevitable, to the realization that most infections are preventable.

Health care is the only industry that invested heavily in IT but nearly flatlined in productivity. Today's ICU is likely less safe and productive than it was 30 years ago. It is packed with more devices and alarms, and none communicate. False alarm rates are extremely high in critical care, 57  ranging from 85 percent to 99 percent in one study, and alarm fatigue is a documented problem. 58  In this project, 18 different disciplines are using team science 4  and working with patients, their families, and the private sector to eliminate preventable harm, optimize patient outcomes and experience, and reduce waste. \\n\\t\",\n",

In addition, each higher level should regularly meet with staff from each lower level to support peer learning and accountability. Improvement of patient safety and quality requires this fractal infrastructure.

       " {'text': \"Informed by the work of the World Association of Nuclear Operators, we are developing tools for peer-to-peer review, in which one provider organization evaluates another, focusing on an outcome (CLABSI), a geographic area (ICU or operating room), or an overall program (quality and safety). 59  Lacking regulatory authority, these reviews focus on learning rather than judging, using validated tools and clinicians, being confidential yet probing. \\n\\tFinally, health care has too few valid outcome measures, limiting the ability to develop programs to reduce other harms besides CLABSI. No U.S. entity is charged with developing measures, reporting performance data, or housing the data. A health care entity similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission would offer hope that one day, the quality committee of a health system's board could function like an audit committee, with clear goals and valid measures, with skilled staff at all levels of the organization monitoring performance, and with clear accountability and performance monitoring. \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': 'In reflecting on our journey thus far, we have learned several things. First, funding was essential to advance the science. Prominent organizations such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the World Health Organization, the Price Family Foundation, and the Sandler Foundation for the Jewish Community Endowment Fund believed in the work and supported our efforts. Medical error is the third leading cause of death, yet Government research funding remains disproportionate to the magnitude of the problem. Second, professional norms are the roots. Clinicians must drive the work and be linked to clinical communities through intrinsic motivation and be energized by peer-to-peer learning to implement the work. Third, all disciplines must be involved to offer a comprehensive perspective on the problems and the solutions. Fourth, science must guide us, and the measures used must be valid. Fifth, we need skilled staff, resources, and accountability at every level to connect the work vertically in the organization and horizontally to clinical communities, clinicians, and other groups. Sixth, health care needs more measures of patient outcomes and costs and an organization similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission to coordinate measure development. 60 \\n\\t',\n",

A good strategy is to seek leadership support before starting action planning and to confirm that support again during and after action plan development. The management style of your senior leaders and the scope of your plans will help determine when it is best to seek their support. \\n\\tIn addition to senior leaders, you will need the support of managers or supervisors who will be involved in the action plan. It is also important to identify influential individuals who may not be in formal leadership positions but whose influence could make the difference between the success or failure of your action plan. Also think about informal leaders in clinical and nonclinical positions. \\n\\tForm an action planning team to help you develop an action plan and implement and evaluate the action plan. Consider the following suggestions when identifying potential team members: \\n\\tRecruit a multidisciplinary team with a mix of roles, expertise, skills, and perspectives. Key skills might include data analysis, quality improvement, human resources, or project management. You may already have an existing committee or group whose members can serve as the core of your action planning team. Remember to include clinicians. \\n\\tAsk a senior leader to join the team and lend support in a visible and ongoing way. This is a great way to engage such leaders in the process and ensure their input and buy-in. \\n\\tInclude team members whose work will be directly affected by the planned initiatives. They will bring an important stakeholder perspective to the development and implementation of the action plan. \\n\\tHold a kickoff meeting to review team members' roles and responsibilities. Keep senior leadership informed of progress. Think about ways to promote teamwork and encourage all members to speak up and share their opinions. Also, keep in mind that team membership is often dynamic—you may want to add members as needed. \\n\\t\",\n",

More than half of practices were able to obtain all measures with rolling 12-month reporting periods, but smaller practices were less likely to be able to do so. Barriers to data collection included practices lacking optional electronic health record (EHR) features, and EHRs’ inability to produce reporting periods across two calendar years.

The authors randomized 226 small and mid-sized primary care practices who worked with facilitators on QI for 12 months to implement POC or POC+PM strategies. The researchers measured the proportion of eligible patients in a practice meeting “ABCS” measures: (aspirin for eligible patients, blood pressure control, Cholesterol control, Smoking cessation counseling), as well as the Change Process Capability Questionnaire at baseline, 12 months, and 18 months. The mean proportion of patients meeting each performance measure was slightly (.04 to .05) greater at 12 months, with improvements sustained at 18 months. At 12 months, baseline-adjusted differences for the POC+PM arm versus POC was: Aspirin 0.02 (−0.02 to 0.05), Blood pressure −0.01 (−0.04 to 0.03), Cholesterol 0.03 (0.00–0.07), and Smoking 0.02 (−0.02 to 0.06); P>0.05 for all. The Change Process Capability Questionnaire improved slightly, mean change 0.30 (0.09–0.51), but did not significantly differ across arms. The authors conclude that facilitator-led QI promoting population management approaches plus POC improvement strategies was not clearly superior to POC strategies alone. \\n\\t',\n",

Researchers randomized 257 small independent primary care practices in New York City into 1 of 4 waves that determined when they would start receiving the 1-year PF intervention. The intervention consisted of practice facilitators conducting at least 13 practice visits over 1 year, focused on capacity building and implementing system and workflow changes to meet the cardiovascular disease care guidelines. Data were extracted for 13 quarters between January 1, 2015 and March 31, 2018, which encompassed the control, intervention, and follow-up periods for all waves, and analyzed in 2019. PF was associated with improvements in the 2 smoking-related outcomes only, the smoking composite (screening for tobacco use and counseling) and smokers counseled. The follow-up smoking measure improved compared with the control period (incidence rate ratio=1.152, 95% CI=1.072, 1.238, p<0.001) and the intervention period (incidence rate ratio=1.060, 95% CI=1.013, 1.109, p=0.007). Smokers counseled also improved when comparing the intervention period with control period (incidence rate ratio=1.121, 95% CI=1.037, 1.211, p=0.002). The researchers conclude that increasing the impact of PF programs that target multiple risk factors may require a longer, more intense intervention and greater attention to external policy and practice contextual factors that may hinder the facilitation process and practice improvement goals. \\n\\t',\n",

This study by the EvidenceNOW national evaluation team identified the organizational elements and infrastructures Cooperatives used to support practice facilitators by reviewing facilitator logs, online diary data, semi-structured interviews with facilitators, and field notes from facilitator observations. Results revealed that each Cooperative partnered with 2 to 16 organizations, piecing together 16 to 35 facilitators, often from other quality improvement projects. Quality assurance strategies by Cooperatives included establishing initial and ongoing training, processes to support facilitators, and monitoring to assure consistency and quality. Cooperatives developed facilitator toolkits, implemented initiative-specific training, and developed processes for peer-to-peer learning and support. The evaluation team found that supporting a large-scale facilitation workforce requires creating an infrastructure, including initial training, and ongoing support and monitoring, often borrowing from other ongoing initiatives. Few regions have facilitation organizations at this scale. The researchers conclude that a dedicated workforce is required to support large-scale practice improvement and would be more efficient and effective than this fragmented approach to quality improvement. \\n\\t',\n",

A total of 263 small PCPs across Oklahoma received the bundled QI intervention to improve ABCS performance. A stepped-wedge design was used to evaluate D&I of QI support. Changes in ABCS measures will be estimated as a function of various components of the QI support and capacity and readiness of PCPs to change. Notes from academic detailing and practice facilitation sessions will be analyzed to help interpret findings on ABCS performance. Lessons learned from this project will guide future strategies for D&I of evidence-based practices in PCPs.

They examined data from about 1500 small- to medium-sized primary care practices and 136 facilitators in EvidenceNOW. They found that facilitators faced practice-level EHR data challenges, such as a lack of clinical performance data, partial or incomplete clinical performance data, and inaccurate clinical performance data. Facilitators responded to these challenges, respectively, by using other data sources or tools to fill in for missing data, approximating performance reports and generating patient lists, and teaching practices how to document care and confirm performance measures. In addition, facilitators helped practices communicate with EHR vendors or health systems in requesting data they needed. Overall, facilitators tailored strategies to fit the individual practice and helped build data skills and trust. The authors conclude that support is necessary to help practices, particularly those with EHR data challenges, build their capacity for conducting data-driven QI, which is required to participate in practice transformation and performance-based payment programs. \\n\\t',\n",

Farmers were in this position a century ago when the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cooperative Extension Program revolutionized farming in the United States. Agricultural experts worked with farmers to test and disseminate innovative agricultural practices that farming is still benefitting from today. AHRQ has developed a similar extension model using practice facilitators and other consultants and resources to transform primary care, which is described in several supplement articles by EvidenceNOW researchers in this supplement. \\n\\t',\n",

He points out that while external facilitation will likely help, transformation is even more dependent on active support from visionary internal leadership and an infrastructure for managing change. But without access to accurate, timely and repeatable measurement data, even a practice with all the other pieces in place will find it hard to identify and improve priority areas. Clinicians and other personnel, plus patients must be engaged in the changes to ensure that they are made in a way that also serves their needs. Finally, it is very unlikely that one size will fit all practice settings, either in approach to change or in what changes each practice chooses to make.

They found that turnover can limit practices' ability to engage in QI activities in various ways. For example, when a staff member leaves, remaining staff often must take on additional responsibilities. What’s more, QI momentum slows as new staff are trained or existing staff are reengaged. Turnover also alters staff dynamics and can create barriers to constructive working relationships and team building. When key practice members leave, they can take with them institutional memory about QI purpose, processes, and long-term vision. The authors conclude that understanding how staff turnover affects QI may help practices, and those helping them with QI, manage the disruptive effects of turnover. \\n\\t\",\n",

In addition, each cooperative, as part of its own robust evaluation plan, has been collecting some unique metrics specific to its own study aims. The supplement also includes an overview and rationale for the initiative from AHRQ and two commentaries from nationally recognized experts in the field of primary care research and practice transformation.

As part of the study intervention, each of the 209 participating practices met with a practice facilitator (PF) to discuss their survey responses and calculate a QICA score. The researchers examined the association between the QICA scores, practice characteristics, their prior experience with managing practice change, and performance on clinical quality measures for three cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors. The QICA score was associated with prior experience managing change and moderately associated with two of three CVD risk factors. Rural practices and those with 2 to 5 clinicians had lower QICA scores.

Results revealed that medical record abstraction resulted in higher performance scores compared with EHR–generated reports. In some cases, misclassification-adjusted performance scores were more similar to EHR–generated performance scores. The findings suggest that meeting a performance target may depend on the method used to estimate performance, which has implications for quality improvement efforts and value-based payment models. \\n\\t',\n",

Practices completed an inventory of local CVD-related resources, which was then used to create a list of printed resources for patients. Half of the participating practices completed the inventory. The cooperative found that it was feasible to create practice-specific resources, but digital distribution was not feasible due to inconsistent use of electronic health record (EHR) systems, workflow variation, and lacking data-sharing infrastructure. The researchers concluded that successful implementation of quality improvement strategies to systematize community resource referral solutions is feasible at small practices, but more research is needed to understand what motivates small practices to participate in implementation of these solutions. \\n\\t',\n",

To determine the interventions’ effects, two models were used—one that did not account for seasonality and one that did. The researchers found that accounting for seasonality did affect outcomes related to blood pressure control. The cooperative concluded that studies evaluating blood pressure control should compare outcome measures across similar seasons, and the length of the measurement period should account for seasonal effects. \\n\\t',\n",

They first identified differences between the two value set specifications of the same CQM. They then implemented the various versions in a quality measure calculation registry to understand how the differences affected calculated prevalence of risk and measure performance. Global performance rates only differed by 0.8%, but there were up to 2.3 times as many patients included with key conditions, and differing performance rates of 7.5% for patients with ‘myocardial infarction’ and 3.5% for those with ‘ischemic vascular disease’. They concluded that the decisions CQM developers make about which concepts and code groups to include or exclude in value set vocabularies can lead to inaccuracies in the measurement of quality of care. One solution is that developers could provide rationale for these decisions. \\n\\t',\n",

Northwest cooperative researchers asked 209 practices to extract and submit four eCQMs from their electronic health records on a quarterly basis using a 12-month measurement period. The measurement periods of the survey data were categorized into non-standard (3, 6, 9 months and other) and standard periods (12 months). For comparison, patient-level data from three clinics were collected and calculated in an eCQM registry to measure the impact of varying measurement periods. Differences between measures with standard versus non-standard periods ranged from –3.3 percent to 14.2 percent between clinics. Variations in measurement periods were associated with variation in performance between clinics for 3 of the 4 eCQMs, but did not have significant differences when calculated within clinics. The researchers conclude that variations from standard measurement periods may reflect poor data quality and accuracy. \\n\\t',\n",

A total of 211 primary care practices in Colorado and New Mexico participated. Practices were instructed on eCQM specifications that could be produced by an electronic health record, a registry, or a third-party platform. Practices received 9 months of support from a practice facilitator, a clinical health information technology advisor, and the research team. Practices were instructed to report their baseline ABCS (aspirin for eligible patients, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation) CQMs as soon as possible. Time to report eCQMs varied by measure and practice type, with very few practices reporting quickly. The median time to report any baseline electronic clinical quality measure was 8.2 months. Practices took longer to report a new cholesterol measure than other measures. The researchers conclude that programs that require eCQM reporting should consider the time and effort practices must exert to produce reports, and that practices may benefit from additional support to succeed in new programs that require eCQM reporting. \\n\\t',\n",

The researchers used ERIC to identify the implementation strategies of the seven cooperatives involved in the initiative, and specified the actor, action, target, dose, temporality, justification, and expected outcome for each. They then grouped implementation strategies by outcomes and justifications. Thirty-three ERIC strategies were used by cooperatives. The researchers identified a range of revisions to the ERIC taxonomy to improve the practical application of these strategies. They also organized ERIC implementation strategies into four functional groupings based on the way they observed how they were applied in practice. The findings suggest revisions to the ERIC implementation strategies to reflect their use in real-work dissemination and implementation efforts. The researchers conclude that the functional groupings of the ERIC implementation strategies that emerged from on-the-ground implementers will help guide others in choosing among and linking multiple implementation strategies when planning small- and large-scale implementation efforts. \\n\\t',\n",

While primary care providers recognize that social needs are as important as medical needs, they feel ill-equipped to address them. The authors note the benefit of an expanded role for community health workers (CHWs). They cite New Mexico as a successful model. The diffusion of clinically integrated CHWs throughout New Mexico’s Medicaid system was sustained by incorporating the cost into the capitated payment to the managed care organizations (MCOs). Moreover, hiring and incorporating CHWs into clinical care became a required component within the contracts of state Medicaid with MCOs. Acknowledging the success of the CHW model, in 2017, New Mexico Medicaid required all MCOs to increase their CHW contacts with clients by 20 percent. Because three of the four MCOs are national, the CHW model begun in New Mexico has been deployed in 12 States. The authors conclude that screening for social determinants at the beginning of every visit uncovers important needs otherwise missed. Immediate referral to a CHW, skilled in assisting the patient in addressing such uncovered needs, expands a primary care clinic’s ability to care for patients. \\n\\t',\n",

Accessed June 30, 2017. \\n\\tAsk the Implementation Team Leader to write the hospital’s definitions of a fall, repeat fall, and fall with injury on the flip chart, before you begin the training. (You will share these definitions during Slide 5.) \\n\\tAlert the Implementation Team Leader or designee (as well as a representative from the QI Team, if appropriate) that he/she/they will be leading a group activity to complete the  Action Plan Tool To Measure Fall Rates and Fall Prevention Practices . \\n\\tSay:  In this last module, we will discuss how to measure fall rates and fall prevention practices. This tracking of key indicators is critical to improving prevention practices in this hospital. \\n\\tSay:  Fall rates and fall prevention practices must be counted and tracked as one component of a quality improvement program. \\n\\tBy tracking performance, you will know whether care is improving, staying the same, or getting worse in response to efforts to change practice. \\n\\tContinued monitoring will help you understand where you are starting from and whether your improvement gains are being sustained. \\n\\tSay:  The goals of Module 5 are to have the Implementation Team agree on and develop a plan for measures to track fall rates, fall prevention practices, and communication of trends by answering the following questions: \\n\\tDo:  Ask the Implementation Team Leader to write the hospital’s definitions of a fall, repeat fall, and fall with injury on the flip chart prior to the training. \\n\\tSay:  Hospital definitions of falls are important when measuring and tracking fall rates. In 2012, the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators, or NDNQI, defined a  fall  with specific terminology. It states: \\n\\t“A patient fall is an unplanned descent to the floor with or without injury to the patient. Include falls that result when a patient lands on a surface where you wouldn’t expect to find a patient.” \\n\\tAll unassisted and assisted falls, whether they result from physiological reasons (fainting) or environmental reasons (slippery floor). Also report patients that roll off a low bed onto a mat as a fall. \\n\\tSay:  Hospital leaders in an acute-care hospital noticed that staff were reluctant to consider and count assisted falls as falls—particularly on rehab units where patients were being appropriately encouraged and tested to increase mobility. \\n\\tLeaders continued to support counting and reporting of assisted falls to be transparent and consistent with NDNQI definitions but also began tracking the number of assisted falls for quality improvement and measurement purposes. \\n\\tAssisted falls usually are associated with less injury. When falls occur with assistance, it suggests that staff have identified at-risk patients and are in attendance during mobilization activities—two important processes of care. \\n\\tSay:  You will want to decide on a uniform definition of a fall and share it throughout the hospital. \\n\\tYour fall definition also needs to be coupled with a culture of trust in which reporting falls is encouraged. \\n\\tAsk:  Do you agree with the NDNQI definition of a fall? Will this definition of a fall be the one this hospital uses for measuring and monitoring fall rates? \\n\\tInstructor’s Note:  If the Team does  not  agree to use the NDNQI definition and/or prefers to continue with their current definition, ask the Team Leader to walk through the hospital’s definition of a fall, and then discuss how it is similar to or different from the NDNQI definition. \\n\\tAsk:  Do you agree with this definition of a repeat fall? Will this be the definition of a repeat fall this hospital uses for measuring and monitoring fall rates? \\n\\tInstructor’s Note:  If the Team does  not  agree to use this definition or prefers to continue with their current definition, discuss the differences between their definition and NDNQI’s definition, as explained in the previous slide. \\n\\tNone, or no injury : The patient is free of injuries (no signs or symptoms) resulting from the fall. \\n\\tMinor : The fall resulted in application of a dressing, treating with ice, cleaning the wound, limb elevation, topical medication, or a bruise or abrasion. \\n\\tModerate : The fall resulted in suturing, application of Steri-Strips/skin glue, and splinting, or caused a muscle/joint strain. \\n\\tThis is the level of fall injury where it is recommended that you perform a root cause analysis to find out why this person fell and possibly avoid a repeat fall. \\n\\tMajor : The fall resulted in surgery, casting, and/or traction, or it required consultation for neurological injury (such as basilar skull fracture or small subdural hematoma) or internal injury (such as rib fracture or small liver laceration), or receiving blood products (such as patients with coagulopathy). \\n\\tDeath : The patient died because of injuries sustained from the fall (not from physiologic events causing the fall). \\n\\tAsk:  Do you agree with these definitions of injury from a fall? Will this hospital use these definitions for measuring and monitoring fall rates? \\n\\tInstructor’s Note:  If the Team does  not  agree to use these definitions, ask them what definitions they will use for fall injuries. \\n\\tSay:  These agreed-upon definitions (of fall, repeat fall, and level of injury resulting from a fall) should be used uniformly throughout the hospital and incorporated into: \\n\\tSay:  The best measure of falls is one that can be compared over time within a hospital unit to see if care is improving. It is recommended that you calculate falls as a rate and not simply as the total number of falls in a given timeframe. Calculating a rate allows you to take into consideration how full or empty the unit was during a given timeframe. \\n\\tMost importantly, be consistent in how you calculate fall rates over time and throughout the hospital. \\n\\tExplore this hospital’s incident reporting system. You may have an electronic incident reporting system that will make it easier to count the number of falls. \\n\\tFind mechanisms to communicate fall incident report information to the Implementation Team, such as a weekly meeting, daily huddle, interoffice memo, or secure email. \\n\\tSay:  To evaluate the completeness of this hospital’s incident report, please use Tool 5A: Information To Include in Incident Reports. \\n\\tFor example, you may consider adding specific fields for contributing factors to falls (such as high-risk medications). \\n\\tSay:  You also need to know the daily census on the unit where you would like to calculate the fall rate. \\n\\tTo learn more about recommendations for capturing data on falls, refer to the resources on page 72 of the Toolkit. \\n\\tIncluded in these resources is the AHRQ Common Formats Web site, which links to a standard structure for collecting data for a fall-related incident report. \\n\\tFirst, count the number of falls that occurred during the month from your incident reporting system. Count all falls, including those resulting in injury. \\n\\tDivide the number of falls by the number of occupied beds that month: 3 divided by 879 equals 0.0034. \\n\\tFollowing the directions, let’s calculate the fall rate for this example from a hospital during the month of February. \\n\\tYou calculate the fall with injury rate in exactly the same way, except you count only the number of falls that resulted in injury. \\n\\tSay:  When we address the Action Plan for measurement at the end of this module, you will identify a person or a team that will be responsible for identifying sources of data to collect, as well as doing these calculations and tracking over time. \\n\\tThe person or team responsible for putting together a plan for tracking falls in the hospital will also want to track the level of injury sustained in each fall. \\n\\tWhen hospitals know their fall rate by type of injury, they begin to get a picture of the severity of the falls and where the most injurious falls occur. Most importantly,\\xa0a hospital can track the causes of falls via post-fall huddles or root cause analyses. The causes of falls should drive interventions to prevent repeat falls. \\n\\tFirst, calculate your rates every month and look at the trend over time. How are the rates changing? Are they improving or getting worse? \\n\\tCan you relate changes in fall rates, including the rates of different types of falls, to changes in practice? \\n\\tFall rates may change based on the season or month of the year. For example, there may be more falls during winter months. Fall rates may also vary by unit. For example, a geriatric psychiatry unit may have different rates than an intensive care unit. \\n\\tFocus on the underlying trend of the data over time. There will be fluctuations. Don’t overreact to any individual month’s data. \\n\\tSay:  Please note that when you first implement a quality improvement program and begin tracking performance, increased fall rates are frequently seen. With increased awareness and education, unit staff members are encouraged to report, and they are becoming better at recognizing falls. \\n\\tAsk:  How do you currently share this hospital’s fall data? Are you reaching everyone who should know about its fall rates? \\n\\tSay:  The third way to use your data is to study in detail what led to the occurrence of each fall, particularly falls resulting in injury. \\n\\tTry to determine whether the falls are irregular unanticipated events (such as a patient’s first seizure that resulted in a fall), or whether there is a pattern to the types of falls. For example, falls related to toileting suggest a specific intervention is needed to improve care. \\n\\tUnfortunately, there are no national benchmarks with which to compare your performance. That’s because of the difficulties in comparing patients across hospitals, since some patients are more likely to fall than others. \\n\\tThere are many ongoing initiatives to determine fall rates using a standardized method across many hospitals. To learn more about these initiatives, see page 77 of the Toolkit. \\n\\tContinually monitor the peer-reviewed literature on updated fall prevalence rates for benchmarking purposes. \\n\\tInstructor’s Note:  Below is a 2013 peer-reviewed article that could be used for hospital unit-specific benchmarking rates. \\n\\tBouldin ED, Andresen EM, Dunton NE, et al. Falls among adult patients hospitalized in the United States: prevalence and trends.  J Patient Saf  2013 March; 9(1):13–17.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3572247/ . Accessed June 30, 2017. \\n\\tSay:  One hospital benchmarked against itself by comparing its data before and after implementing a Fall Prevention Program. The data showed a reduction in falls with major injury from 6 in 2014 to 4 in 2015 and 1 in 2016. The data also showed a reduction in fall rates for both the entire hospital system and the pilot units. \\n\\tMany of the interventions found to be successful on the pilot units are now being spread to other units. Interventions to prevent falls and fall injuries are tracked. These include low beds, fall mats, helmets, and hip protectors. \\n\\tSay:  Data are more than just numbers. For instance, they can show you if your program is improving. Some ways to display data in a way that tells a story are run charts, control charts, and annotated run charts. \\n\\tSay:  Run charts simply display a series of data points over time. The individual data points are plotted and then connected (as shown by the blue line) to show that they occurred in order. \\n\\tRun charts can be used to determine if a process is changing, including whether it is responding to a quality improvement initiative. \\n\\tIn addition to showing the data of interest, in this case your mean fall rate data, there is usually a summary statistic plotted, like the mean or the median, as well as a goal. \\n\\tSay:  Control charts are a special type of run chart. They have a central line depicting the average rate over time, shown in this chart by the central black line. \\n\\tControl charts also display upper and lower control limits (the dashed parallel lines) that are calculated using all of the data included in the plot. The limits are based in probability and take into account the variability of the data in the chart. \\n\\tControl charts help you understand whether the changes you are seeing are within or outside the range of normal variation. \\n\\tWe aren’t going to spend any more time on control charts today. For a more indepth look at how to use control charts to analyze data on fall rates, see page 74 of the Toolkit. \\n\\tSay:  Let’s take a look at another run chart and talk about how we can begin to use data to tell a story. This slide shows a run chart depicting the number of falls per 1,000 patient days over a 2-year timeframe. Also plotted in this figure is the national average. \\n\\tFor this hospital, you can see that during 2008, the hospital’s fall rate is fluctuating and a little above the national average, shown as 3.1 falls per 1,000 patient days. Then, starting in January of the second year, the fall rate is below the national average or benchmark. The rate varies over time, but falls appear to be decreasing from the previous year. \\n\\tSay:  This run chart again shows the same fall rate data from the previous slide (blue line). However, it also shows a breakdown of the fall rate by the different types of falls that occurred—anticipated falls, accidental falls, unanticipated falls, and intentional falls. \\n\\tYou can see that in this chart, most falls are anticipated physiological falls (the red line). In other words, they are preventable. \\n\\tCapturing your fall improvement interventions and creating a storyboard such as the one shown in this slide helps you to look for trends and variation in your data relative to your specific implementation efforts. \\n\\tWhen you plot your fall data over time, especially in an annotated run chart, you can see how the fall rate has changed over time. You can also see how fall rates change in response to implementing prevention strategies and, importantly, if results are being sustained over time. \\n\\tDo:  Suggest that those who are doing the data collection and analysis view the following webinars for more information: \\n\\tCreating Control Charts To Interpret Fall Data—AHRQ Fall Prevention Program Implementation Sharing Webinar \\n\\tSay:  We can understand why we need to track fall rates in our hospital. Fall rates are outcome measures. \\n\\tSay:  Measuring fall rates tests how your hospital or unit is performing, but fall rates are limited in that they do not tell you how to improve care. \\n\\tTo know where to focus improvement efforts, it is important to measure whether key practices to reduce falls are being done correctly and in a timely manner. \\n\\tTracking process measures helps us assess if we are making the changes we intended to make in our Action Plan and if they are making a difference. \\n\\tSay:  Many important practices could be measured in assessing fall prevention, but let’s focus on a couple of practices to begin. \\n\\tPutting appropriate care planning in place that addresses each risk factor identified during fall risk factor assessment. \\n\\tSay:  As the first step in prevention, it is essential to ensure that a fall risk factor assessment is accurately performed within 24 hours of admission. \\n\\tInstructor’s Note:  The hospital may have agreed to use another scale or a simple checklist of risk factors for falls in the hospital. If so, refer to that instead of the Morse Fall Scale. \\n\\tSay:  Look at the sample protocol for assessing performance of fall risk factor assessment on page 78 of the Toolkit. \\n\\tSay:  For risk factor assessment to make a difference, all risk factors identified on the risk factor assessment need to be addressed in the care plans. \\n\\tAnd the care plans need to be acted on. This requires critical thinking on the part of staff and a tailored approach to each patient based on the individual patient’s risk factors. \\n\\tSay:  Tool 5B combines medical record review with direct observation to assess if and how fall prevention care processes were carried out. \\n\\tSay:  As a starting point, it is recommended that you combine medical record review with direct observation, using a manageable sample size, as suggested in Tool 5B: Assessing Fall Prevention Care Processes. \\n\\tSay:  Let’s pull it all together with an Action Plan for measuring progress. Please take out the Action Plan Tool To Measure Fall Rates and Fall Prevention Practices. \\n\\tDo:  Ask the Implementation Team Leader or designee to lead this activity. Have him/her go through each of the key indicators on the tool. With the help of the Team, he/she should fill in the responsible person or group and the expected date of completion. \\n\\tSay:  Now that we have a preliminary fall measurement Action Plan, let’s end this module by folding this information into Key Intervention 5 of the overall Fall Prevention Program Action Plan . \\n\\tSay:  Key Intervention 6, sustain the redesigned prevention practices, is the only key intervention that you have not yet addressed. You will complete an Action Plan for sustainment at one of your upcoming Team meetings. \\n\\tBy using your talent, skills, and expertise, you have developed a preliminary Action Plan as a framework for the Fall Prevention Program. This is a major 1-day achievement. Think of this Action Plan as a blueprint for implementing this initiative. \\n\\tSay:  Today, you made great progress in beginning to develop an implementation plan for fall prevention in this hospital. \\n\\tYour draft Action Plan covers the key interventions you plan to use, who is responsible for the plans, and when they will be completed. This is your launching pad for your program. \\n\\tThank you for your participation on the fall prevention Implementation Team and your efforts to make this hospital safer for patients. \\n\\tA care plan addressing every deficit on the fall risk factor assessment has been developed and is being implemented. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'AHRQ is steadfastly committed to finding innovative approaches that accelerate the spread of clinical best practices that deliver the best and most timely care. It has been estimated that it takes about 17 years for a health care discovery to be translated into everyday practice. This is an unacceptable delay, which harms patients who could benefit from discoveries and which can contribute to health care disparities. \\n\\tTo learn more about AHRQ’s efforts in this area, I recently traveled to New Mexico to see the work of AHRQ grantee Sanjeev Arora, M.D., and his team of implementation pioneers, whose achievements have helped speed the implementation of evidence-based practices in rural, primary care settings. \\n\\tIn 2004, AHRQ awarded Dr. Arora a grant to evaluate the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes initiative (Project ECHO), which opened the lines of communication between disease experts at an urban academic medical center and rural primary care physicians. Using a tele-consultation network, Project ECHO helps practitioners effectively treat patients with chronic, complex diseases in their own communities.\\xa0  \\n\\tThe results of this work, which were published in the  New England Journal of Medicine , demonstrated that with the support of the ECHO model, primary care physicians in rural communities across New Mexico were able to provide care that resulted in health outcomes equal to or better than care provided at the academic center, significantly improving treatment for patients with hepatitis C in these communities. \\n\\tAs described in AHRQ’s recently published  profile of Dr. Arora , utilization of the Project ECHO model has expanded to 89 hubs in 30 States and 15 countries outside the United States. It’s used by entities such as the Department of Defense’s Defense Health Agency and Veterans Health Administration health care systems, as well as several agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services. \\n\\tThe ECHO model essentially serves as a force multiplier. \\xa0When sub-specialist physicians and primary care physicians, nurses, and physician assistants work together to identify best practices in treating complex conditions, a valuable increase occurs in the number of patients who receive the most up-to-date, research-based care. \\n\\tBuilding on the success and growth of Project ECHO, AHRQ has undertaken a new initiative focused on medication-assisted treatment of opioid-addicted patients. A frustrating aspect of the opioid epidemic is the lack of treatment options for millions of Americans living in rural communities. This summer, AHRQ launched four grants to study how to expand primary care treatment for patients battling opioid dependence in rural communities.\\xa0 All four teams have chosen to use the ECHO model as part of the solutions they are testing, and one of the projects includes Dr. Aurora and his team directly.\\xa0 By using the Project ECHO model, we believe our grantees will be able to significantly broaden the reach of medication-assisted treatment, an effective, evidence-based therapy that uses both medications and behavioral support to empower people to manage their addiction. \\n\\t',\n",

For example, all staff members\\xa0are trained to assess for health literacy and to use simple, clear instructions and language when speaking with patients. The company's clinical call scripts include the teach-back method, adherence counseling techniques derived from AHRQ tools, open-ended questions, and strategies to address language barriers. \\n\\tSandra Leal, PharmD, MPH, chief operating officer at SinfoníaRx, said, “AHRQ’s tools allow pharmacists to address issues and improve health literacy, making the most of their limited time with patients. Busy pharmacists can find what they need in one consolidated resource. There are manuals for pill cards, templates to use, and guidance for patients who are struggling to afford medications.” \\n\\tWhile SinfoníaRx primarily works with clinical call centers providing medication therapy management from four national sites, the company also works to establish integrated clinical pharmacy services in a variety of settings. These include a hospital discharge program, integrated behavioral health clinics, accountable care organizations, and patient-centered medical homes. Telehealth and other strategies help provide resources to communities, clinicians, and patients. \\n\\tPatients talk by phone with a pharmacist to address their personal needs. The teach-back method—where patients repeat back in their own words how they are going to take their medication—can be particularly useful to pharmacists as they counsel patients. This helps in the transition-of-care program to assess, intervene, and address any gaps in the patient’s knowledge of their condition, according to Jenny Bingham, PharmD, transition of care coordinator. \\n\\tTalking to patients about their medication can have a significant impact on their health. “Pharmacists are an integral component during the transition-of-care period 30 days after hospital discharge,” Bingham said. Examples of how she has helped patients include the following: \\n\\tA woman who was experiencing chest pain, headaches, heart palpitations, fast heart rates, and lower back pain told Bingham that she was afraid to call her doctor. Bingham explained the possible ramifications if the patient did not seek emergency medical attention for her cardiac symptoms and persuaded the patient to call her provider. The doctor sent the woman to the hospital. The next day, Bingham learned that the patient was administered an antiarrhythmic in the emergency department for tachycardia. Bingham contacted the woman’s outpatient cardiologist and scheduled an immediate follow-up appointment. \\n\\t\",\n",

Makers of health IT products are generally reticent to share information about the design of proprietary software, complicating efforts to achieve interoperability and standardization across the health IT sector. In addition, health care delivery entities may be wary about sharing information with their competitors. Some use EHR deployment strategically, such as a hospital supporting installation of their vendor's EHR system into primary care practices within their market reach, so that these physicians have a workflow incentive to refer their patients to the hospital with a compatible information system. One panelist observed that good care coordination often means less money for health care institutions. For example, ordering a repeat test generates revenue, while obtaining results from a test performed at another institution does not. Indeed, the resources required to obtain results from an outside source (whether through institutional investment in an HIE or time spent by individual providers to seek out information from other sites) and to integrate them within the receiving EHR (ranging from scanning documents to developing mapping algorithms that recode lab results from one system to another) generally increase non-reimbursable costs for a health care entity.

Additionally, the existing evidence is very heterogeneous in the interventions, outcomes, and settings studied; with a lack of sufficient numbers of studies of promising interventions using common outcomes to allow for rigorous comparisons of effectiveness.

No more than 30 seconds should be used with an individual maneuver before attempting the next one. Discuss the plan for delivery if primary maneuvers do not work. \\n\\tIf McRoberts and suprapubic pressure fail to relieve the obstruction, the clinician should try intravaginal procedures. Episiotomy may be necessary to allow for placement of the clinician’s hand but is not necessary if hand placement is possible. Each of the rotational maneuvers has an eponymous name; however, several authors emphasize the importance of learning the procedure and not the name. \\n\\tAnterior shoulder:  The clinician’s entire hand is placed on the posterior surface of the fetal anterior shoulder, and pressure is applied toward the infant’s anterior chest to adduct and flex the anterior shoulder. \\n\\tPosterior shoulder:  The clinician’s entire other hand is placed on the anterior surface of the posterior shoulder and pressure placed that is meant to abduct and extend the posterior shoulder. \\n\\tDelivery of the posterior arm can be considered before or after rotational steps. The ideal approach is for the clinician to put pressure in the antecubital fossa of the posterior arm, flexing the arm and sweeping the hand and arm over the anterior fetal chest and delivering the hand through the vagina. This will flex and adduct the shoulders and should disengage the anterior shoulder to allow the body to deliver. \\n\\tIn a patient who is relatively mobile, the all-fours maneuver or rotating the woman to knee-hands position can help to dislodge the shoulder. This can be disorienting for the clinicians, but a systematic approach can assist in an orderly use of the previously attempted steps. \\n\\tClavicular fracture is not uncommon in neonates after shoulder dystocia. Separate from this, however, is the deliberate fracture of the clavicle as a technique to relieve the shoulder dystocia by reducing the bisacromial diameter. This procedure is considered a heroic measure due to the significant risk of brachial plexus injury associated with this procedure. It is performed by applying upward (in a cephalic direction) digital pressure on the fetal clavicle, against the maternal pubic ramus. \\n\\tIf the above procedures have failed to achieve a vaginal birth despite several attempts at sequential procedures and there is still a live baby with significant time passage, one could attempt a cephalic replacement procedure by applying firm, steady pressure on the flexed fetal head and then proceeding to cesarean section. \\n\\tSymphysiotomy:  This procedure is relatively common in patients in developing countries when safe cesarean section is not available. It involves dividing the symphysis pubis under local anesthesia.\\n\\t',\n",

Language categories to be used by health care entities to collect these data and possible code sets are then considered. \\n\\tThe number of people nationwide needing language assistance is growing rapidly ( Shin and Bruno, 2003 ), and individuals with these needs interact with the health care system daily. The extent of this interaction is revealed by recent surveys on encounters with LEP patients in hospitals, physician offices, and community health centers: \\n\\tEighty percent of hospitals provide services to LEP patients regularly, and 63 percent of hospitals encounter these patients daily or weekly ( Hasnain-Wynia et al., 2006 ). \\n\\tEighty-one percent of general internal medicine physicians commonly treat LEP patients (54 percent at least once a day or a few times a week; 27 percent a few times a month) ( American College of Physicians, 2007 ). 1 \\n\\tEighty-four percent of federally qualified health centers provide clinical services each day to LEP patients—45 percent see more than 10 LEP patients per day; 39 percent see from one to 10 per day ( National Association of Community Health Centers, 2008 ). \\n\\tOne study of hospitals indicated that 80 percent of hospitals have a health information technology (Health IT) field dedicated to collection of language names, primarily to identify the languages needed for interpreter services ( Regenstein and Sickler, 2006 ). Health care entities use a number of different approaches to collect this information: some limit the response categories to English, Spanish, and an \"other language\" category, while others offer respondents 200-300 languages from which to choose ( Regenstein and Sickler, 2006 ;  Tang, 2009 ). A study of the practice of internal medicine physicians found that only 28 percent kept detailed records of primary language needs, and about two-thirds of those who did record this information did so on paper rather than in a data system ( American College of Physicians, 2007 ). By contrast, Kaiser Permanente, a health plan and a service provider covering eight states, began collecting data in 2009 in its electronic health record (EHR) system using a list of 131 spoken languages and 119 written languages ( Tang, 2009 ). \\n\\t',\n",

The latter approach is particularly prone to error (Flores,  2005 ,  2006b ). Telephone interpretation services are also available from numerous sources; more than 200 different languages are offered by some interpretation and translation services ( ASIST Translation Services, 2009 ;  Language Line Services, 2009 ). Depending on the diversity of the population served, an entity may encounter persons with language assistance needs in just a few or many languages. New York Presbyterian Hospital, for example, reports providing interpretation in 95 languages ( NQF, 2009 ). Reimbursement for the provision of interpretation and translation services is not always available (e.g., not under Medicare, or when states elect not to provide a match for Medicaid funding for such services) ( Bagchi and Stevens, 2006 ;  Chen et al., 2007 ;  Ku and Flores, 2005 ;  Minnesota Department of Health Office of Rural Health Primary Care, 2008 ;  Ponce et al., 2006b ;  Youdelman, 2007 ).

The most obvious ways are to provide direct language assistance during a clinical encounter and information for follow-up care, such as chronic disease management education or discharge instructions in a patient's language.

A hospital might want to track whether patients who receive language assistance have better outcomes on quality metrics compared with those who do not receive those services, or it might want to track whether those services are timely ( Box 4-2 ). Language data also are useful for determining the need for translated materials; for example, Kaiser Permanente translated its Health Care Glossary into six languages to communicate commonly used terms and explanatory information about tests or conditions more effectively ( NCQA, 2007 ).

For example, LEP patients who needed but did not receive interpreter services experienced less satisfaction with their health care interactions, including less friendliness, time spent, and perceived concern for the patient, than those provided with or not needing interpreters ( Baker, 1998 ). Recent studies have also revealed how language barriers can result in delays in prehospital care ( Grow et al., 2008 ), less social interaction between dental staff and LEP patients ( Hammersmith and Lee, 2008 ), and more negative clinical experiences in health care settings ( Hampers et al., 1999 ) relative to non-LEP patients. One survey of care provided mainly in safety net hospitals found that the experiences of uninsured patients with access to an interpreter were comparable to or better than those of insured patients with no need for an interpreter ( Andrulis et al., 2002 ).

The lower use of services by non-English speaking persons may also reflect the patient's inability to articulate medical or mental health concerns to health care providers that are less easily measured by objective laboratory tests so that appropriate diagnoses can be made ( Sentell et al., 2007 ). \\n\\t\",\n",

The absence of language concordance between patient and provider and consequent reliance on ad hoc interpreters may impede disclosure of sensitive information ( Marcos, 1979 ). It also negatively impacts comprehension of instructions and other treatment information necessary for adherence to and continuity of treatment ( Wilson et al., 2005 ).

It called for a fundamental change in the health care delivery system through a complete redesign of patient/provider relationships and revised patient care processes, leading to improved health care outcomes. \\n\\tBefore these studies, some pioneering individuals had been advocating for the use of measurement and data to judge how effective processes were at achieving desired outcomes. Notably, W. Edwards Deming talked about the science of improvement in his System of Profound Knowledge in the early 20 th  century. \\n\\tDr. Deming was a statistician who used statistical process control tools to determine sources of variation that led to waste in manufacturing. His approach to improvement shifted focus from individuals to underlying processes as the primary source of error and variation. This concept of process improvement helped pave the way for today’s view of QI. In his 1982 book  Out of the Crisis , Deming laid out his philosophy for transformation of organizations, emphasizing the concept of total quality management and the importance of understanding the type of variation in a process. The more variation, the more waste and inability to consistently produce the outcomes desired. His 14 points, shown in  Table 4.2 , still resonate today. Although written for manufacturing, they have become part of health care thinking and are inherent in all QI methodologies. \\n\\t',\n",

The MFI was developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) in 1996 and published in  The Improvement Guide: A Practical Approach to Enhancing Organizational Performance  (1996). \\n\\tThe MFI uses a rapid cycle process called Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to test the effects of small changes, make them, and ultimately spread the effective changes through the practice or organization (see  Figure 4.1 ). The MFI begins by asking three simple questions: \\n\\tQuality improvement teams then introduce and test changes designed to achieve the improvement aims using successive PDSA cycles until they arrive on a change they believe will produce the desired results and is ready for implementation and spread.

San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; 1996. \\n\\t*  The Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle was developed by W. Edwards Deming. [Deming WE. The new economics for industry, government, education. Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology; 1994.] \\n\\tYou will need to be prepared to teach your practices how to use the MFI, and specifically, how to carry out repetitive and systematic processes for testing and then implementing improvements, the PDSA improvement cycles. Your goal will be to instill these as “habits” in your practices. Every improvement activity they decide to undertake should be an opportunity to encourage them to take a systematic and data-driven approach to implementing, testing, and then sustaining the change. \\n\\tAn essential part of introducing a culture of quality in a practice is assisting the practice to shift its focus from individuals to processes. Organizations can often get mired in finding individuals to blame for less than optimal outcomes, an approach that can produce a punitive and problem-focused work environment. You can use the MFI and the basic tool of PDSA cycles to assist practices in making a shift to thinking about their processes and systems and how they can be modified to produce better outcomes. \\n\\t',\n",

One of the best ways to do to this is to encourage the practice to go through the discipline of completing an improvement form based on the MFI. The mere act of completing the form helps reinforce the idea and build the internal discipline and skill of using a defined process for testing and adopting changes to the usual course of business. \\n\\tYou will also need to know how to introduce the MFI to your practices. This can be difficult in a practice that is enthusiastic about making improvements. It can also be difficult in a practice where buy-in to improvement efforts is low. The enthusiastic practice may lack patience for systematic improvement work and may have difficulty instituting the discipline needed to use the PDSA process.

While patient education is necessary, it alone is not sufficient. Rather than being prescriptive or hierarchical, coaching interventions should be patient-centered and tailored to the needs and concerns defined by the patient and his or her situation. As coaches, the care managers therefore must have timely access to information on patients' behaviors, priorities, skills, and needs.

Some of the findings on variations within and among population groups reported in Chapter 2 were generated from pooled analyses of the NHIS sample to increase the size of the samples. Pooling, however, may not work for the smallest population groups; for example, it would take at least 8 years of NHIS data to obtain the sample size needed for reportable estimates on the NHOPI population. Over such a long time span, significant changes can compromise the validity and relevance of such estimates for health care policy and planning purposes. Where pooling is useful, standardized measures of demographic variables would improve the quality of the pooled data.

You may find that there is not a single process for carrying out a particular task, but several variations in how the activity takes place. \\n\\tAn important rule of thumb when mapping a process is “the person who controls the process controls the pen.” This means the person who actually carries out a particular process is the one who maps that step of the process. \\n\\tMany additional activities carried out by a practice will need to be redesigned when it transitions to team-based care.

It is important to identify and consider these dependencies when redesigning workflow, as the effects of redesigning a workflow can be positive or negative. \\n\\tIt will be important for the team to be able to determine the potential peripheral effects of redesigning workflows. The Model for Improvement and PDSA can help a practice identify unanticipated effects of redesigned processes and correct them before taking them to scale. \\n\\tNew workflows will often require realigning jobs, changing staff time allocation, roles, and responsibilities to fit the redesigned workflows. This in turn will require changes to policies and procedures, job descriptions, training, and accountability/reporting systems for ensuring tasks are completed. \\n\\tWhen working with a QI team and practice staff on redesigning workflow, you will need to provide them with a copy of the existing workflow.

Any process that relies on memory is prone to error. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t If more skills are required, can current staff be trained or do duties need to be shifted to more qualified staff? \\n\\tOnce the team has developed a new workflow, it will need to be implemented and evaluated. The PDSA process from the Model for Improvement can be a good way to test the effectiveness of a new workflow.

This finding is consistent with other similar data. DRG data are of limited usefulness in all-payer data unless derived after data are received, as providers are often not required to report DRGs to payers that do not use DRG-based reimbursement. \\n\\tThe secondary diagnosis codes range from 53%-66% for the second position, then appropriately drop in frequency after about 5 diagnosis codes. \\n\\tSecondary diagnosis codes can be included in records of different types but typically are more frequent in inpatient records where secondary codes can affect reimbursement.

Because of the nested nature of the data, it is possible to build measures, but attribution remains a complex problem in most data sources. \\n\\tProviders may use multiple Medicaid numbers or National Provider Identification numbers or provide care across different locations based on administrative and logistic features of their practice. Therefore, it can be difficult to attribute all encounters to the provider. The team observed a large number of providers in some quarter-State combinations, suggesting single providers using multiple provider IDs. The team did not evaluate whether the location of service was populated for most provider claims or if the population was consistent with the data submission guidelines.

       " {'text': \"Care coordination is a core pillar of the PCMH. As part of AHRQ's PCMH initiative, in 2011, AHRQ published the “Care Coordination Measures Atlas,” which provides a framework and describes existing measures of ambulatory care coordination for potential adoption to monitor the effectiveness of this new delivery model. \\n\\tPromoting the most effective prevention and treatment practices for the leading causes of mortality, starting with cardiovascular disease. \\n\\tThis is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years by promoting aspirin for people at risk, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation (the “ABCS” of cardiovascular disease). \\n\\tAHRQ will support Million Hearts through conferences and communications that will speed the identification and diffusion of innovative strategies along with evidence-based reports to improve the delivery of the Million Hearts ABCS in communities and health care systems. \\n\\tAHRQ funded researchers at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center to develop and pilot health information technology (IT) to bring state-of-the-art medical knowledge about the effective treatment of persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to primary care providers and nurses in underserved areas. \\n\\tApproximately 3.2 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV, which causes 12,000 deaths per year. It is the leading cause of liver transplantation. Although treatment is available and effective, it can cause serious side effects and, therefore, must be carefully managed by a medical team. Typically, such care and treatment is not available outside of university medical centers. \\n\\tProject ECHO demonstrates that health IT can help solve the problems of underserved communities by empowering primary care clinicians to provide high-quality specialty care locally. \\n\\tMaking quality care more affordable for individuals, families, employers, and governments by developing and spreading new health care delivery models. \\n\\tThe mission of the Value Portfolio is to reduce unnecessary costs and waste while maintaining or improving quality. The aim is to help the Department fulfill its mission to help Americans receive high-quality, efficient, and affordable care by creating a high-value system, in which providers produce greater value, consumers and payers choose value, and the payment system rewards value. \\n\\tTo meet these needs, the Portfolio produces quality and efficiency measures, data, and tools; conducts research on system redesign, public reporting, and payment strategies; and facilitates translation and implementation of evidence-based strategies into policy and practice. \\n\\tEvidence is built through grants and contracts, and strategies are implemented through practice-based or community-based networks. An example of the latter is the 24-community quality collaborative, known as Chartered Value Exchanges, which implements across communities and entire States research findings on public reporting, payment, waste reduction, and quality improvement. The Portfolio also relies heavily on quality and cost data produced through AHRQ efforts such as MEPS, HCUP, and the National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports (NHQR/DR). \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': \"The Improving Communication and Teamwork in the Surgical Environment module helps an organization improve teamwork and communication. This module is meant to augment the existing teamwork and communication tools and individual coaching modules of the CUSP toolkit while offering additional strategies to improve teamwork and communication specifically in the surgical environment. Throughout the module, best practices from the ambulatory surgery setting are highlighted. \\n\\tIn this module, you will learn concrete ways to improve communication and teamwork in the surgical environment. I will first provide an overview of the challenges with communication and teamwork. Then we will discuss these methods to improve teamwork and communication: \\n\\tIn this section, we will discuss the meaning of communication, barriers to effective communication, and the impact of poor communication on patient outcomes. \\n\\tFinally, we will learn how team members' differing views on teamwork can impact communication and teamwork in surgery. \\n\\tGetting necessary information to the right people so decisions can be made is the definition of communication we will use today. This involves communication among everyone on the team. \\n\\tPart of effective communication is briefing and debriefing in order to give information before a team acts. Followup communication after the team completes its job is also crucial. \\n\\tThe surgical environment makes communication challenging. Operating and procedure rooms can be chaotic places where background noise makes hearing difficult. Masks cover people’s mouths, which muffles their speech and prevents others from seeing their mouths as they speak. Often, when an instruction is given, it is not clear who is supposed to carry it out. \\n\\tGiven this environment, it is no surprise that communication challenges can harm patients. Communication failures are a frequent cause of patient harm. Studies have found that communication failures are the cause of up to 80 percent of operating room adverse events. \\n\\tFurthermore, lack of communication has resulted in serious patient safety events such as teams performing a procedure on the wrong site, performing the wrong procedure, using incorrect implants, not having appropriate equipment, mislabeling specimens, and delaying surgery. \\n\\tThe majority of studies to date focus on communication within surgical teams. While there is not a large body of evidence on communication barriers among teams that perform nonsurgical procedures such as endoscopies, we can infer that similar communication errors are prevalent and that patients have been harmed. Good communication leads to improved patient outcomes and is a major component of improved teamwork in the surgical environment. \\n\\tTeam structure refers to the composition of an individual team or of a multiteam system. Team structure is an integral part of the teamwork process. A properly structured patient care team enables and results from effective communication, leadership, situation monitoring, and mutual support. \\n\\tProper team structure can promote teamwork by including a clear leader, involving the patient, and ensuring all team members commit to their roles in effective teamwork. \\n\\tIt is important to identify and recognize the structure of teams, because teamwork cannot occur in the absence of a clearly defined team. Further, understanding how a team is structured and how multiple teams interact in a center is critical for planning the implementation of quality improvement strategies. This graphic from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's or AHRQ's TeamSTEPPS program depicts some of the interactions that occur in care teams. Occasionally throughout this module, other ideas from TeamSTEPPS will be referenced. \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Teamwork is working together toward a common goal, knowing everyone's roles, respecting people, welcoming and listening to others' views, using available resources to complete the job, understanding what is going on around you and keeping track of the big picture to maintain connections with team members. High-performing teams also— \\n\\t communicate often and at the right time to ensure that fellow team members have the information they need to contribute. \\n\\tPoor teamwork causes many problems. Studies show that surgical teams who exhibit fewer teamwork behaviors put patients at higher risk for death and serious complications. So, there is a direct link between teamwork and patient outcomes.\\xa0 \\n\\tAs we seek solutions, we should understand that not everyone who works in the surgical environment sees the current level of teamwork the same way. A 2006 study conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins, “Teamwork is in the Eye of the Beholder,” surveyed 60 operating room team members about their perceptions of teamwork, communication, and leadership in the operating room or OR. \\n\\tAs shown in this graph, 87 percent of surgeons rated the communication and collaboration of OR nurses as high or very high, but only 48 percent of OR nurses gave the same rating to surgeons. There are clearly two different pictures here, almost as if nurses and surgeons do not work on the same team. \\n\\tThe two bars on the right show that this difference in perspective includes anesthesiologists. Eighty-four percent of surgeons rated the communication and collaboration of anesthesiologists as high or very high, while 70 percent of anesthesiologists gave that rating to surgeons. \\n\\tIn both cases, surgeons believed their communication and collaboration with the people around them was at a higher level than those people did of the surgeon. \\n\\tBefore we can start improving communication and teamwork, it is important to have a good understanding of how your coworkers view teamwork and communication. Before you start work to improve communication and teamwork, consider administering a culture survey to better understand how team members view communication and teamwork. One example used by many facilities is the AHRQ Survey on Patient Safety culture. The results will help focus your quality improvement efforts and make the case that the teams in your facility can do even better. \\n\\t\",\n",

PMID: 17254927. \\n\\tFor the rest of the presentation, we will focus on specific ways to improve communication and teamwork in the surgical environment. We will start with briefings. \\n\\tBriefings originated in the aviation and nuclear power industries to ensure necessary information was communicated to every team member. These techniques are being integrated into health care through programs such as TeamSTEPPS. \\n\\tThe briefing is a discussion that facilitates clear and effective communication. This discussion puts all team members on the same page before the start of the procedure and helps create a sense of teamwork and collaboration. \\n\\tA well-performed briefing also creates an environment in which team members speak up if they perceive a problem, because the surgeon or physician invites team members to do so. \\n\\tFinally, briefings help set the tone for the procedure. If there is open communication at the beginning of the case, team members are more likely to keep communicating with one another. \\n\\tOne example of an early preprocedural briefing is the briefing card that the Kaiser Permanente medical system developed in 2003 for its Orange County, CA, hospitals. \\n\\tThe briefing consisted of key information shared among the entire team before the start of the case. One key to the briefing was that every item was written down on cards in every operating room, so memorization was not required. \\n\\tUse of the briefing card led to a drop in wrong-site surgeries and other adverse events. It also increased staff morale and reduced nursing turnover. \\n\\t4 Shepard S.  Teamwork in the OR . The Doctors Company: Patient Safety/Risk Management Strategies.\\xa0  An Ounce of Prevention . 2015. Accessed May 2015. \\n\\tFrom the work at Kaiser and other work around briefings since then, we know briefings help surgical teams learn the game plan and get on the same page. \\n\\tBriefings help teams monitor the situation and raise red flags when needed. They also prevent surprises because information previously memorized is shared among team members. \\n\\tBriefings have been proven to reduce the number of times a procedure is interrupted to obtain information or act on newly obtained information, such as leaving the room to get equipment or supplies. Through these measures, briefings can help improve patient safety. \\n\\tGood briefings have several critical components. Team members introduce themselves so that no one is anonymous. The introductions also give team members a chance to speak before the case starts. The simple act of someone saying their name makes them more likely to speak again if necessary. A good briefing incorporates other safety checks the team already performs. \\n\\tFor example, the briefing should incorporate the Joint Commission's Time Out and identification and confirmation of the procedure site and side. This is of great importance in procedures that are side specific. \\n\\tThe surgeon shares the operative plan and difficulties anticipated during the operation, which lets team members prepare for problems. \\n\\tThe anesthesia professional shares the anesthetic plan and airway and other concerns, allowing adequate time for preparation by other team members. \\n\\tThe nurse and scrub technician share any equipment issues or other potential problems. They also confirm that all medications present on the field are correct and labeled. \\n\\tThe briefing is a good time to make sure the size and type of any implant to be used are correct. Finally, the surgeon or physician sets the tone with this statement: “Does anybody have any concerns? If you see something that concerns you during this case, please speak up.”\\xa0 \\n\\tWhen you are looking to enhance your briefing or start a briefing in your facility, remember that a good briefing occurs when everyone on the team has a chance to say something before the start of the case. Finally, the briefing should be performed when all team members are present. In the United States, because the surgeon or physician is often not present until the procedure is about to begin, this means the briefing should occur immediately before skin incision or the start of the procedure. \\n\\tLet’s see what a good briefing looks like. This clip shows a team performing a briefing in an ambulatory surgery center. \\n\\tNote: This slide includes a video. If you have trouble accessing the video on this slide, it is also available here:  https://youtu.be/NhFU4h3aQE4 . \\n\\tWhat are some of the qualities of a good briefing that you saw? Did you notice that everyone said something? Did you notice that the surgeon set the tone at the beginning of the procedure when he asked team members to speak up if they had any concerns during the case? \\n\\tLet's move to another critical aspect of improving teamwork and communication, which is debriefing at the end of the case. \\n\\tThis is another process from the aviation industry that ensures critical information is exchanged among team members. In this section, we will discuss what a debriefing is and how it can help us in the surgical environment. \\n\\tWe will also discuss the components of a good debriefing and ways to use the information from the debriefing to make changes in your surgical suite. In this section, we will call this idea “continuous quality improvement.” \\n\\tA debriefing is a discussion at the end of the case that all team members participate in, ideally before the patient is transferred to the recovery area. \\n\\tIt gives the team a chance to make a plan for recovery and think about what happened during the procedure and act on any problems that are identified. This discussion can include key concerns for the patient’s recovery, equipment problems encountered, and improvements that would have made the case safer or more efficient. \\n\\tOne of the most difficult components of performing a debriefing is making sure that it occurs when all team members are present. In the presence of an awake or aware patient, the team may have to move the conversation to a later time. We will talk about this in a few minutes. \\n\\tDebriefings add great value to facilities that use them. They can help identify minor problems that still require attention, as well as more serious problems. The type of debriefing that we will discuss should be used after every case and is focused on fixing everyday problems encountered in the surgical environment, such as wrong instruments or mislabeled specimens. If a serious patient safety event takes place during the case, such as a wrong site surgery, this debriefing may need to be modified, and it may be helpful to utilize other tools and processes. One such tool is AHRQ's Learn From Defects Tool. \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Debriefings have several benefits. They bring the team together after the procedure to confirm critical information. \\n\\tDebriefings let the clinical team pause and discuss what went well or what could have been done better during the case in a safe environment that permits open communication. They can facilitate a discussion of how to solve problems so they do not reoccur. \\n\\tThey can help promote patient safety by reinforcing the importance of discussions that might improve care or the efficiency of the team. \\n\\tWhen you are considering incorporating a debriefing into your common practice or enhancing your current debriefing process, remember the components of a good debriefing. These include verification of sponge and needle counts, review of the procedure performed so that everyone on the team confirms the procedure is recorded as it was actually done, and confirmation of specimen labeling by reading back the patient’s name to ensure specimens are properly processed. \\n\\tA good debriefing also includes a discussion about equipment issues or problems identified during the procedure that need to be addressed afterwards. This may include concerns for the patient’s recovery and management so that it travels with the patient to the next place of care. Lastly, there should be a discussion of how the team could provide even better care in the next case. \\n\\tLet’s see what a good debriefing looks like. This clip shows a team performing a debriefing in an ambulatory surgery center. \\n\\tNote: This slide includes a video. If you have trouble accessing the video on this slide, it is also available on the AHRQ Web site here:   https://youtu.be/fKmNhVn9R1I . \\n\\tIn the video, the debriefing was conducted in the room in front of the patient. It is good practice to debrief in the operating room whenever possible. Many surgical operations and procedures are performed with local or regional anesthesia, so the patient is at least partially aware. \\n\\tThe surgical team should judge what is appropriate to share in front of the patient. The underlying principle is that the care team should use common sense in deciding when to discuss serious problems or other issues in front of the patient. Simple problems with equipment can safely be discussed in front of the patient. If team members feel that part of the debriefing discussion cannot be carried out in front of the patient, they should arrange to meet as soon as possible to have the discussion in a safe environment where they can communicate openly. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Many facilities across the country and globally have started to use debriefings routinely. These facilities have found the debriefing helpful to identify problems. \\n\\tThe most common problems reported when teams have debriefed at the end of a case include near misses, equipment issues, mislabeling of specimens, and incorrect sponge and needle counts. \\n\\tIdentifying these problems is not enough. Facilities that use debriefings and get the most out of them use them for continuous quality improvement. \\n\\tTo use debriefing for continuous quality improvement, create a system to collect information given in debriefings. Someone should be assigned to monitor the debriefing, collect the information, and actually fix the problems reported. It is also key to communicate with the person or team who reported the problem to let them know its status and the steps that have been or will be taken to fix it. \\n\\tFixing problems identified in the debriefing can get physicians and staff to buy into using briefings and debriefings. Often, team members get frustrated when they report problems that do not get fixed. An example is when a surgeon keeps receiving the same pair of dull scissors. Facilities that use debriefings have reported increased engagement of all team members, including physicians. \\n\\tWhen done properly, briefings and debriefings are two of the most valuable ways to improve communication and teamwork. \\n\\tOne of the best ways to put briefings and debriefings into effective use is through a surgical checklist. The next part of this presentation will focus on what a surgical checklist is and how it can be used as a vehicle for briefings and debriefings. \\n\\tI will also give examples of checklists that incorporate briefings, debriefings, and essential process checks that should be completed for every patient every time.\\xa0 \\n\\tThe surgical checklist was designed to improve communication and teamwork in the surgical environment. It has roots in the Orange County briefing card mentioned earlier. The checklist integrates process and communication items into one tool to ensure that team members communicate necessary information with each other and perform essential safety steps for every patient undergoing surgery. \\n\\tFinally, the checklist is designed to be used by the entire team and not only one team member. It should be read aloud from a hard copy. Team members should never memorize the checklist. \\n\\tThe checklist can help in many ways in the surgical environment, including improving communication. It enhances communication among team members and it helps everyone raise awareness and focus on what is going on in the room. When using the checklist effectively, team members set a positive tone as they participate in the checklist. All of these things improve teamwork. \\n\\tSignificant evidence supports the use of the surgical safety checklist, and actually shows that the benefits of performing a checklist are enhanced when combined with medical team training. \\n\\tThe first study listed is the original pilot study of the World Health Organization or WHO Surgical Checklist. This study demonstrated a relationship between use of the checklist before surgeries in eight sites around the world and positive results after surgery. Both complications and mortality from surgery decreased at nearly every site. \\n\\tAdditional studies listed here have all demonstrated similar decreases in complications and often in mortality. \\n\\tAs evidence accumulates, a strong evidence base exists in many environments. While the first study focused primarily on environments in the developing world paired with evaluation and use of the checklist in the developed world, more recent studies have examined the use of the checklist in sophisticated medical settings including the Netherlands and the United States. \\n\\tThe checklist can be used as a communication tool, and many checklists include briefings and debriefings.\\xa0 \\n\\tThe WHO Surgical Safety Checklist was developed to work in any setting. All communication items on this checklist can be used in any facility in developed or developing countries, but it is not specifically made for use in the United States and developing countries. For example, it does not reflect some of the U.S. standards of practice, like venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. \\n\\tThe Safe Surgery 2015 Checklist was developed specifically for use in U.S. facilities. On this checklist, teamwork and communication elements have been enhanced to include elements specific to U.S. hospitals. This version of the checklist also includes items recommended by the Surgical Care Improvement Program and The Joint Commission. \\n\\tThe cardiac surgery checklist was developed for use in cardiac procedures in the United States because cardiac operating rooms have different requirements from a general operating room. \\n\\tFinally, there is the ambulatory surgery center checklist for use in an ambulatory surgery center, or ASC. This checklist includes critical elements needed in the fast-paced environment of an ASC. Let’s look a little closer at the ASC checklist to see how the briefing and debriefing are incorporated. \\n\\tThe ASC checklist contains elements meant to improve both teamwork and process performance. Each section of the checklist has specific elements aimed at improving both. \\n\\tHere, you can see the “before the patient enters the room” portion of the checklist suggested for use in ambulatory surgery settings. It is at this point that the nurse and anesthesia professional discuss necessary information with the patient and talk to each other about the patient’s history and needs. This is also the time that the nurse and anesthesia professional can confirm that implants and imaging are available if necessary. \\n\\tHere, you can see the “before skin incision” portion of the checklist suggested for use in ambulatory surgery settings. This portion of the checklist is designed for the team to use immediately before skin incision or the start of the procedure. Many facilities in the United States are required to stop at this point in care to perform essential safety steps to verify patient identity, procedure, and procedure site. Let’s talk about each of the items included in this portion of the checklist. \\n\\tGetting the entire team to stop all activity at this point in the case can sometimes be difficult. It is important for all team members to stop what they are doing and actively participate in this discussion. One member of the team should lead this portion of the checklist and initiate this discussion by asking everyone the question “Is everyone ready to perform the timeout?” \\n\\tAsking if the team is ready to perform the timeout encourages everyone to stop other activities and helps set a positive tone by asking team members if they are ready instead of telling them to stop, which is what typically occurs in facilities in the United States. As you can see, this checklist template does not dictate which team member initiates this portion of the checklist. This is intentionally vague so each facility can designate which team member is responsible for starting this portion of the checklist discussion. In some facilities the nurse leads this portion of the checklist, and other facilities may find it helpful for the surgeon or physician to initiate this discussion. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': \"The next item on the checklist is, “Please state your name and role.” As we previously discussed, having everyone in the room introduce themselves by name and role gives team members a chance to speak before the case starts. The simple act of someone saying their name makes them more likely to speak again if necessary. \\xa0 \\n\\tThe next portion of the checklist incorporates those essential verifications of patient identity, procedure to be performed, and procedure site. This section also includes an item to prompt the team to discuss antibiotic prophylaxis administration, and if it is needed, confirmation that the prophylaxis is completely infused. \\n\\tNow, let's take a closer look at the elements in the briefing section that are designed to improve teamwork and communication. During the briefing, the surgeon shares changes to the operative plan and the possible difficulties. This is important because it can reveal information not always apparent in information from surgical nurses, surgical technicians, and anesthesiologists. Similar sharing is encouraged from the anesthesia professional, the circulating nurse, and the scrub technician. \\n\\tFinally, during the briefing the surgeon reads a statement that encourages everyone to speak up if they see anything that might affect the care of the patient. The surgeon’s statement is, “Does anybody have any concerns? If you see something that concerns you during this case, please speak up.” \\n\\tAt the end of the case, the checklist prompts the team to have a discussion that includes process measures for every patient, including counting the instruments, sponges, and needles, and confirming counts with all team members. \\n\\tThe name of the procedure is accurately recorded because it is discussed with all team members. Sometimes an operation is different from the one initially planned. All team members should know that information before they leave the operating room so it can be recorded accurately in the patient's record. \\n\\tA debriefing is also included in this final portion of the checklist before the patient leaves the operating room. \\n\\tDuring the debriefing, the team pauses again to discuss important issues and seeks input from all team members. The team starts this portion of the discussion by talking about any equipment problems that may need to be addressed. \\n\\tThe team should then discuss the key concerns for the patient’s recovery and management so that the patient makes a safe transition to the recovery room. \\n\\tFinally, there should be an opportunity to improve what happened in every case by asking and seeking information concerning ways to improve the safety and efficiency of the procedure that was just finished. \\n\\tIn this section we will describe essential steps when implementing a surgical checklist or changing a checklist already in place. These steps include— \\n\\tOne of the most important tasks when beginning this work is building an implementation team. This team should have at least one representative from each position the checklist potentially affects. Perspectives from every discipline that works in the surgical environment will be needed to make sure the checklist works for your facility and to gain the necessary buy-in. The team should include at least one— \\n\\tOften we forget to include an administrator on these types of teams. An administrator will play a key role because they likely can provide resources for projects. They also can update facility leadership on the project's progress and/or barriers. \\n\\tPhysicians are also a key component. Physicians might not have a lot of time, but it is important to identify one willing to participate meaningfully. The physician may not be able to attend every meeting, but can help you modify and test your facility checklist. It will also be helpful to have a physician help engage other physicians when it is time to implement the checklist more widely. \\n\\tMake sure that your implementation team also includes an anesthesia professional. This can be an anesthesiologist or a CRNA (nurse anesthetist). \\n\\tFinally, a nurse and a scrub technician are key roles on the implementation team. Both the nurse and the scrub technician have an important role in the checklist and their feedback is important in customizing the checklist so that it meets the needs of all team members. \\n\\tEvery checklist needs to be customized for the facility. This promotes ownership of the resource. At a minimum, add your facility name and logo to your checklist. \\n\\tWhen modifying your checklist, think about the types of cases your team performs, your patient population, and any special needs your facility may have. \\n\\tWhen customizing the checklist, remember it is a series of discussions the team performs and that the checklist should be read from a hard copy and not memorized. \\n\\tFinally, do not make your checklist too long. For an uncomplicated procedure, each section of the checklist should take less than 2 minutes to perform. When facilities have put the checklist into place, the checklist tends to grow. Every item needs to be carefully analyzed before it makes it onto your checklist. On the next slide, we will show questions your implementation team should discuss when you add or remove an item. Successful checklists should be clearly written, concise, and accurate. \\n\\tHere are some critical questions you should discuss with your implementation team when adding or removing items from the checklist. \\n\\tFirst, “Is this a critical safety step at the risk of being missed?” We want to minimize the risk to the patient as much as possible, but teams can miss critical safety steps in the complicated surgical environment. Documenting known allergies, doing essential imaging, and administering antibiotic prophylaxis are examples of steps at risk of being missed. \\n\\tThe next question is, “Is this a safety step you might not notice if it isn't done?” This space on your checklist should be reserved for items the team might not notice if they were not performed. Doing iodine/tinted prep is an example of an item that is not relevant for a checklist because the team can see if the prep is on the patient because of its coloring. Antibiotic prophylaxis is a good candidate for a surgical checklist because the team cannot see if the antibiotics have been given, so the checklist provides a reminder to complete that step. To ensure antibiotics are completely infused, the anesthesia professional must communicate this information to the team. If missed, not giving antibiotics to the patient can cause serious harm to the patient.\\xa0 \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': 'The third question is, “Is this an item discussed at a time when all relevant team members are present?” It is important to discuss items at a time when those who must be part of the conversation are present. For example, the team should not discuss the operative/procedure plan when the surgeon/physician is not present. \\n\\tThe fourth question is, “Is the checklist the best way to take care of it”? The checklist is not the ideal way to take care of everything. Make sure there are not better ways to address the items you are considering including in your checklist. While some facilities include fire risk assessment, hair removal, and checks of pressure points on their checklists, other facilities have found other processes and tools to take care of these things. \\n\\tThe fifth question is, “Can something be done about it?” Timing is everything with the checklist. The items should be discussed at a time when something can be done about it. For example, the checklist will not be an effective prompt for the team to discuss hair removal after the hair has already been removed. \\n\\tFinally, the implementation team should discuss whether the item improves communication between team members and sets a positive tone. These are usually the most difficult items for teams to perform consistently, and they are the most commonly removed items when facilities modify their checklist. If you remove these items, make sure the concepts behind each of them are included in your checklist in another way. \\n\\tSlide 38: Testing Your Checklist Outside of the Patient Environment Using Tabletop Simulation – Part One \\n\\tWhen implementing the checklist in your facility or changing your existing checklist, the first thing to do before bringing it into the surgical environment is to test it using a tabletop simulation. \\n\\tDuring the tabletop simulation, team members should sit down around a table, take a role, and walk through it to make sure their checklist works for their facility and that it prompts the team to discuss necessary information for every patient undergoing a procedure. The place to figure this out is not in the surgical environment, but outside of it. We change many things without testing only to find out that the change didn’t work. Testing the checklist outside the surgical environment helps you identify potential changes on the checklist without making mistakes in front of the patient or causing harm. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Say the words on the checklist out loud. Pretend you’re in a real case. Do a full simulation. You don’t need a fancy simulator. You can pretend you’re in an operating or procedure room. Many times words that make sense on paper don’t reflect what you do in your center, and that won’t be obvious until somebody says them. Say them outside the surgical environment. After you go through your checklist, talk about changes before you use it with a patient. \\n\\tNote: This slide includes a video. If you have trouble accessing the video on this slide, it is also available on the AHRQ Web site here:   https://youtu.be/V_nU8WxCH2w . \\n\\tDid you notice that each person took a role to play and read through the checklist as if they were actually in a procedure? Why might this be important? \\n\\tSlide 40: Testing Your Checklist Outside of the Patient Environment Using Tabletop Simulation – Part Two \\n\\tOne of the most important steps in performing a tabletop simulation is the discussion that occurs after you run through it. This is a chance for everyone to talk about what they think should be changed and how it felt to use the checklist. \\n\\tNow, let\\'s see what the last part of the tabletop simulation looks like when the team talks about how it felt to say the words on the checklist and what might need to be changed for their facility. \\n\\tNote: This slide includes a video. If you have trouble accessing the video on this slide, it is also available on the AHRQ Web site here :  https://youtu.be/FY1ZgmC4oJU . \\n\\tCan you see the benefit of performing a tabletop simulation when your facility is putting a tool like the checklist in place? \\n\\tAfter you modify and test your checklist, the next step is to test it in a case. Start by testing with one team for one case. When you are first testing the checklist in the clinical environment, test the checklist initially with checklist implementation team members. \\n\\tIf you can\\'t test the checklist with implementation team members, test it with a supportive physician. If you test the checklist with individuals who haven\\'t been previously exposed to the checklist, remember to train everyone how to use it before they try it with a patient. You might need to meet with them beforehand and walk through the checklist together. \\n\\tAlways have an implementation team member in the room to collect feedback about changes. Then modify the checklist as necessary. \\n\\tThe next step is to test the checklist with one team for one day and modify as necessary. The process of testing with teams and modifying the checklist can be repeated multiple times with the same team or with different teams to ensure the checklist works before it is finalized. \\n\\tIn this section, we will discuss how to improve communication by helping people speak up when they see something that concerns them. We will discuss the importance of voicing concerns in the surgical environment and barriers to speaking up. The solution is structured language using the CUS technique, which we will listen to some examples of. This technique is taught in many quality improvement initiatives, including AHRQ’s TeamSTEPPS. \\n\\tStudies show that many times when adverse events occur in the surgical environment, someone knew something was about to happen but did not speak up. Reported problems include wrong-site surgeries, wrong procedures, wrong or missing implants, wrong medications, unidentified allergies, and/or wrong equipment. Patients are harmed unnecessarily, and health care providers can deliver safer care to prevent these events. \\n\\tMany barriers keep people from speaking up. These include fears of being embarrassed, feeling stupid, being ridiculed, being yelled at, being wrong, or saying something that might not be important. Many people think someone won’t listen to them when they speak up or that it’s not important. \\n\\tA potential solution is the use of structured language. Its use is standard practice in many high-risk industries and on high-performance teams. In structured language, specific agreed-upon words indicate a problem. These words act as flags to signal that something in the room is of concern or is dangerous to the patient. \\n\\tStructured language works best when both the sender of the information and the receiver of the information understand the words. We are going to use “CUS” to indicate safety concerns, but other words are also used. For example, in some hospitals, the word “clarity” is used instead of “concern.” \\n\\tA feature of structured language is escalating speech that gradually indicates increasing levels of concern. Escalating speech is better received than “STOP” when something is of concern. When the conversation starts with “STOP,” emotions are triggered and the situation is made worse. Structured language lets people voice their concerns without being extreme. \\n\\t\"Stop.\" This indicates a safety issue. This is the extreme. If the problem reaches this point and nothing changes, there should be a plan for the next step in this situation. \\n\\tNote: This slide includes an audio recording. If you have trouble accessing the audio on this slide, it is also available on the AHRQ Web site here :  https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient-safety/hais/tools/ambulatory-surgery/sections/implementation/training-tools.html . \\n\\tAnother way to improve communication is closed-loop communication. We will discuss how closed-loop communication enhances team communication and we’ll listen to an example of closing the loop in the surgical environment. \\n\\tClosed-loop communication is another way to improve the team’s ability to exchange clear and concise information. In closed-loop communication, we acknowledge receipt of information, and then we confirm we understood what the information means. \\n\\tThe sender begins by initiating the message and passing it to the receiver, who demonstrates acceptance of the message and gives feedback that message has been received. Finally, the sender verifies with the receiver that the message has been received. \\n\\tLet\\'s listen to examples of closed-loop communication in the surgical environment. This is an audio clip demonstrating how closed-loop communication can be used clinically. \\n\\tNote: This slide includes an audio recording.

In this presentation we have discussed several ways to do this, including— \\n\\tConducting team briefings before every case ensures that all team members have the essential information needed to take care of the patient. \\n\\tHaving the entire team pause at the end of a case to discuss a plan for the patient and talk about anything that could be done better for the next case. \\n\\tImplementing a surgical checklist can help facilities improve communication and teamwork. The checklist is a vehicle to bring briefings and debriefings to the surgical environment. \\n\\tTeaching team members structured language like CUS and closed-loop communication can lead to improved teamwork and communication. \\n\\tImproving team communication is not an easy fix and requires patience and time. However, if you are persistent, there is tremendous benefit for the patients we care for every day and for our fellow team members. \\n\\tExamples of checklists, including the ambulatory surgery center checklist, the cardiac surgery checklist, the endoscopy checklist, the Safe Surgery 2015 checklist, the WHO surgical safety checklist, and TeamSTEPPS Briefing and Debriefing Checklists. \\n\\tMazzocco K, Petitti D, Fong KT, et al.

John, a beloved pioneer in health services research, was an international leader in quality improvement. Carolyn Clancy, M.D., admired as a clinician and educator, worked tirelessly to extend his legacy. Rick Kronick, Ph.D., passionately energized AHRQ\\'s expertise in health care data collection and analysis. \\n\\tBut it was Tim Ferris, M.D., senior vice president, population health management, Massachusetts General Hospital, who reminded me about \"voltage drops\" as part of his presentation last week at the Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) annual meeting. \\n\\tI was wowed by the talent and enthusiasm of those who attended the conference. This was a large group—well over 2,000—whose members clearly share a commitment to creating a more efficient and effective health care system.\\xa0 \\n\\tTim\\'s reference to \"voltage drops\" was spot on. He reflected on the wealth of meeting presentations that described elements of a high-functioning health care system. One of the great challenges we face, he noted, is not simply collecting more information about how and why these elements work, but figuring out how to apply and expand them. \\n\\tI\\'m feeling very optimistic about AHRQ\\'s potential to meet this challenge. The Agency\\'s staff is brimming with ideas and strategies for making health care better. Our  EvidenceNOW ,  TeamSTEPPS , and  Quality Indicators  initiatives are terrific examples of AHRQ\\'s deep commitment to the implementation of effective improvement strategies.

Care plans are living documents that are revised to reflect a person\\'s changing needs. In person-centered care, staff places a premium on active listening and observing, so staff can adapt to each resident\\'s changing needs regardless of cognitive abilities.\" \\n\\t',\n",

Eliminating the assembly-line approach to care and embracing a philosophy of residents as individuals are key characteristics of a resident-centered facility. Facilities should strive to accommodate resident choices and preferences as one way to support the resident\\'s ability to achieve the best and safest quality of life possible. The key to person-centered care is considering that no decision about the resident should be made without asking, \"Have the resident and the family participated in this decision?\" If the answer to this question is no, then the next step should be to find ways to include the resident and family in their own care decisions. \\n\\t',\n",

Accessed September 22, 2014. \\n\\tPerson-centered care is different from the traditional care model. Care of residents in long-term care settings was originally designed around a medical model. This traditional model is similar to care delivery in a hospital, where care is driven by diagnosis, care tasks, and the individuals who perform the tasks. In the traditional model, management staff frequently make the decisions, with minimal input from frontline providers and without much personalization based on the individual's needs. Some long-term care facilities are using a model that demonstrates person-centered care. In this style of care, the resident and family are actively engaged in their own care. Residents and family are encouraged to be as engaged as the resident's condition allows them to be. The culture at a person-centered facility promotes the philosophy that each person has the  opportunity  to participate knowledgably and effectively in their care. This slide provides specific examples to help staff understand the differences between the two models of care. Many nursing homes deliver care that reflects characteristics of both styles. \\n\\t\",\n",

Since October 2007, medical centers designate diagnoses as: \\n\\tOne major limitation of the measure is that only VTE events with a POA indicator of N or U are included in the measure. This results in an underestimation of VTE associated with hospitalization (and potentially preventable HA-VTE) as it fails to recognize that VTE associated with hospitalization may not present until  after  the index hospitalization. \\n\\tCapturing patients who are readmitted with newly diagnosed VTE is very important, as a very large proportion of VTE can present in the 30 days after hospital discharge. This is especially true for medical inpatients, and readmitted VTE patients may outnumber not-present-on-admission patients. \\n\\tA second major limitation of this measure is the definition of \"potentially preventable.\"  Any  prophylaxis provided before the VTE diagnostic order date leads to the conclusion that the VTE was not preventable. For example, a VTE event that is discovered on the tenth day of hospitalization would be deemed not preventable if the patient had received mechanical prophylaxis on the ninth hospital day but inadequate or no prophylaxis throughout the remainder of his or her stay. \\n\\tAHRQ\\'s Quality Indicators include a Patient Safety Indicator (AHRQ PSI #12) that does not use the POA indicator and is focused only on patients with surgical diagnoses or operating room procedure codes. 8  Using this indicator, some patients who are readmitted with VTE may be captured, but only if VTE is not the primary reason for admission. \\n\\tImprovement teams need to understand the important limitations of ICD-9 coding and administrative data in tracking outcomes. \\n\\tFirst, not all patients will be readmitted to the same hospital; others who are diagnosed with a VTE event may remain in the skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility that accepted the patient after hospitalization. In addition, not everyone with HA-VTE will be readmitted; newer oral anticoagulants and low-molecular-weight heparin can be used to treat some patients with VTE without hospitalization. \\n\\tThe predictive value of the present on admission designation is only 71 percent and 81 percent in studies of surgical and medical inpatients, respectively, with higher performance in those with total knee arthroplasty. 9-12  Both underestimates and overestimates of HA-VTE rates can occur. \\n\\tSecond, although major guidelines 13 , 14  recommend against routine screening for asymptomatic VTE in the hospital, the practice remains common for high-risk populations (e.g., trauma or cancer patients) in many hospitals. Hospitals performing more routine screening will therefore appear to have higher rates of symptomatic VTE than those that do not perform this screening. \\n\\tEven in centers that do not practice routine screening for asymptomatic patients, medical centers with ongoing improvement and educational efforts may have a lower threshold for ordering tests. This surveillance bias can make it especially hard to compare performance across different medical centers and to identify top performers. 15-18  In fact, a recent study found that hospitals with higher quality scores for VTE often had worse risk-adjusted VTE rates, most likely due to surveillance bias. 15  Increasingly sensitive CT scans and variability in diagnosing small, subsegmental PE also pose challenges to tracking VTE over time and to comparing performance across different institutions. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Finally, the improvement team should revisit the accuracy of administrative coding for HA-VTE and attempt to reduce any inappropriate routine screening for deep vein thrombosis. Screening practices and coding accuracy can vary widely from hospital to hospital, and this may represent a valid opportunity to reduce the reported number of hospital-associated cases of VTE. \\n\\tSeveral strategies are available to improve on the VTE-6 metric (and AHRQ PSI #12) and to track potentially preventable and nonpreventable HA-VTE. \\n\\tOne strategy to better track the incidence of HA-VTE is to set up a data query to capture both patients who develop VTE during an admission  and  patients who are readmitted within 30 days with a newly diagnosed VTE. Another data point to consider tracking and reporting is the incidence of upper extremity DVT. This is an important but distinct diagnosis with different implications for prevention. \\n\\tHA-VTE should be considered potentially preventable if there was a significant lapse in protocol-directed VTE prophylaxis (i.e., rather than the VTE-6 standard of a complete lack of any prophylaxis) prior to VTE diagnosis at any time prior to the diagnostic test for VTE. Diagnostic coding is not perfectly accurate, and chart review allows validation of whether the patient experienced an HA-VTE. \\n\\tChart review also allows the team to prioritize its educational efforts and understand where the process is most prone to failure. In addition, chart review can raise awareness of HA-VTE, and potentially preventable HA-VTE can be referred for peer review where the powerful human stories revealed by chart review can garner support for the VTE prevention program. \\n\\tThe methods reviewed above rely on identification of VTE diagnostic codes. A better method, if feasible, is to identify and review all VTE cases as they are diagnosed by CT angiograms of the chest, Doppler-ultrasound tests of the extremities, ventilation perfusion scans, venograms, and autopsy findings. \\n\\tOne center, for example, designed a query in the digital radiology information system that could efficiently pull up a roster of all VTE diagnostic studies performed in the previous 1 to 3 days. 19  A nurse data reviewer screened the studies for a new VTE diagnosis, then determined through further chart review if the VTE was hospital associated or community acquired. If an HA-VTE was diagnosed, further review using a case review form determined whether the HA-VTE was potentially preventable. This strategy allows a more efficient, less labor-intensive, and more complete case review, often completed while the patient is still in the hospital. \\n\\t',\n",

Hospitals can implement these best practices, including medication safety interventions, to achieve measurable improvements in patient safety .\" \\n\\tFrom the earliest stages of his career, Jeffrey Schnipper, M.D., M.P.H., has been focused on improving healthcare delivery, particularly during transitions in care. “As patients move from one location to another, information about their care needs to be conveyed accurately,” according to Dr. Schnipper, who directs research and cares for patients at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. \\n\\t\"As a hospitalist, it was very clear that a lot of our patients were having issues around transitions in care and that it was important to come up with delivery solutions to bridge that gap,\" said Dr. Schnipper, who is also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. With support from AHRQ over the past two decades, he has been able to address his goal of improving care delivery, particularly around medication safety issues. \\n\\tMedication safety errors are among the most common adverse events in healthcare. One technique to prevent these kinds of problems is medication reconciliation, which means ensuring that medications are checked as patients move from one location to another to prevent unintended mistakes. To address this problem, Dr. Schnipper initiated the AHRQ-funded Multi-Center Medication Reconciliation Quality Improvement Study (MARQUIS) at five hospitals in 2010. \\n\\tThe initial study identified ways to check prescription accuracy and adherence, evaluate the interventions, and disseminate results so that the learning could be shared with others. “This research filled a critical need, as rigorously designed studies comparing medication reconciliation practices were scarce at that time,” said Dr. Schnipper. The  study  produced important insights on medication reconciliation best practices, for example, finding that hospitals should hire and train pharmacy staff to assist with medication reconciliation at discharge. A toolkit was developed based on the study’s findings to help other facilities implement these best practices. \\n\\t',\n",

One example is a smart pill box for patients discharged from the hospital to the community. The pill box decreases medication discrepancies by comparing dispensed medications against the regimen documented in the electronic health record, and it tracks medication use each time medications are removed from the pill box. The tool contains pre-filled medication trays and offers HIT features to facilitate adherence, including the ability to send alerts to patients or caregivers by phone, email, or text if medication trays are not accessed. The pill box also generates adherence reports to help monitor compliance. “HIT tools such as the smart pill box can play an instrumental role in medication reconciliation best practices as they automate processes to produce immediate results and remove the chance of human error,” Dr. Schnipper explains. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Dale Shaller:  Well let’s start off with the big picture. Results from CAHPS surveys, as you know, are increasingly being reported to the public. They’re also being used in pay-for-performance programs. Some people express concern about using information from CAHPS surveys to measure health care quality. Why  should  CAHPS results be used in public performance reports and payment programs? \\n\\tRebecca Anhang-Price:  It’s a great question! I think the main answer is that patient experiences are an essential element in any assessment of health care quality. They’re intrinsically important – that means they matter to patients. Patient experience surveys give patients a voice to describe those experiences. And good patient experiences go hand in hand with better clinical outcomes. Because of that, measures of patient experience help health care providers improve care and help patients choose between health care providers. They can also help health care purchasers identify good value. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Dale Shaller:  Well Rebecca, do patients really have the expertise that they need to answer questions about the quality of their health care? \\n\\tRebecca Anhang-Price:  Well Dale, CAHPS surveys ask patients to report on what happened to them in the health care setting. That includes things like their interactions with their health care providers, like how respectful and responsive their providers were to their needs, whether they received understandable information, and got timely answers to medical questions, and got appointments for care when they needed them. Patients are the best and only source of that kind of information. What CAHPS surveys don’t do is ask about the technical quality of care, since that information is better obtained from other sources. Measures from CAHPS surveys are meant to complement technical measures of health care quality, to provide an overall assessment of the quality of care. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Dale Shaller:  Okay, but it does seem that what patients might expect to happen could affect how they respond to the survey. So for example, if a patient expects to get a prescription or some other treatment or maybe a diagnostic test, wouldn’t they maybe give their doctor a poor rating if the doctor didn’t do what they expected them to do? And wouldn’t those kinds of situations encourage doctors to do what patients ask for in order to improve their scores instead of providing the most appropriate care? \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Rebecca Anhang-Price:  Well research suggests that patients value how well their providers communicate more than whether their providers offer a specific treatment. And there are a lot of proven strategies that health care providers can use to ensure that patients have a positive experience even when they don’t get exactly what they ask for. These strategies are things like involving patients in decision making, discussing the context for the patients’ requests, proposing alternatives, and offering the possibility that a request will be fulfilled later if the patient’s condition warrants it later. To our knowledge, there’s no published evidence indicating that health care providers get higher CAHPS scores by providing inappropriate or unnecessary care. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': \"Dale Shaller:  Okay, I see that and that’s helpful, but if doctors and hospitals spend a lot of their time and effort to improve patient experience scores, like CAHPS, wouldn’t that distract them from providing high quality clinical care? So in other words, is there a tradeoff between providing really great patient experiences and getting superb clinical outcomes? \\n\\tRebecca Anhang-Price:  There’s a lot of evidence showing that it’s possible for health care providers to simultaneously offer better patient experiences and better clinical quality. In fact, we believe that good clinical care depends on both superior technical quality and great patient experiences. Dozens of studies have found either a positive relationship or no relationship between CAHPS scores and ratings of clinical quality, and that suggests that there is no tradeoff between those two. \\n\\tDale Shaller:  Well I know that some people are concerned that it’s just not fair to compare CAHPS scores across different health care providers or health plans. And it does seem like there are factors beyond their control – like say, the age or education of their patients– that could affect how their patients respond to the surveys. \\n\\tRebecca Anhang-Price:  It's true that factors like how old or how sick patients are can affect CAHPS scores. But those differences can be accounted for by a statistical technique called case-mix adjustment, which makes it possible to estimate how health care providers would score if they all served patients with similar characteristics. Case-mix adjustment aims to level the playing field. And it reduces the likelihood that providers will avoid taking patients who they think will report poor experiences because of factors that aren’t in providers' control. \\n\\t\",\n",

It does seem like the surveys to some people are really too long and that that discourages patients from responding. \\n\\tRebecca Anhang-Price:  Actually, the evidence shows that survey length has very little effect on response rates. And we’re learning that the design and wording of the questions appear to matter more than the number of questions. \\n\\tDale Shaller:  I see, well Rebecca, I know that the CAHPS program is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, so congratulations! How’s the program trying to keep pace with all of the changes that are taking place in the health care system? \\n\\tRebecca Anhang-Price:  Well, over the past 20 years, CAHPS surveys have grown and changed to meet the needs of health care providers, of patients and families, and others who use the surveys. For example, the CAHPS team is exploring strategies for reaching patients in new ways, going beyond traditional mail and telephone surveys. More Americans are using electronic means to communicate, so the CAHPS team is looking into how to leverage that while maintaining high standards of survey science and patient privacy protection. Our 20 years of experience have led to a scientifically sound survey process and some of the best outcome measures around. We are continuing to enhance CAHPS surveys to meet users’ needs all the time. \\n\\t',\n",

Dr. Wilson has worked with stakeholders across the public and private sectors to engage in health care issues. \\n\\tThe National Quality Strategy is a centerpiece of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The challenge given to us by the Act was to create a national strategy for quality improvement that would improve the delivery of health care services, patient health outcomes, and population health; no small task, I might add.

To date the primary groups involved include the Department of Health and Human Services, a government-wide working group on health care quality, and two groups convened by the National Quality Forum: the National Priorities Partnership and the Measures Application Partnership. \\n\\tAs you can see, a wide range of stakeholders came together to develop the Strategy. That's why I'm so excited you all have joined. If we're going to achieve nationwide alignment to the National Quality Strategy and focus our efforts we really need the commitment and engagement of stakeholders at the State and local level on the frontlines because as we know, all health care is local. \\n\\tSo what is the Strategy? The Strategy is to concurrently go after better care, healthy people/healthy communities, and affordable care. \\n\\tFor those of you familiar with the Institute of Healthcare Improvement this may sound familiar, and it should. The National Quality Strategy builds on over ten years of work the Institute of Healthcare Improvement has done in working with the Triple Aim. How we build on that is to emphasize the health of all peoples in geopolitical communities and the affordability of health care for multiple groups, including families who are paying extremely high premiums and high deductibles, and employers whose products have been going up in price because of the increased cost of employee benefits. These considerations are addressed by the Strategy, in addition to concerns regarding the per capita cost of health care, which is an indication of what we're paying as a society. \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Hopefully these aims make sense to you and resonate with you, but I think you'd agree they're pretty broad. To better focus our efforts on critical priorities we see driving improvement in this country, we chose six priorities. \\n\\tThe improvement priorities are patient safety, person- and family-centered care, effective communication and care coordination, prevention and treatment of the leading causes of mortality, health and well-being, and making quality care affordable. \\n\\tWhether a stakeholder's organization focuses on one priority or aligns their entire strategic plan to all six priorities, we believe any concerted effort to align is important and impactful for improvement. \\n\\tTo drill down a bit further, I'd like to walk through how we think about one particular priority: patient safety. We believe that there are opportunities in patient safety that advance all three aims. \\n\\tHow can we do that? By focusing on three specific long term goals. The long term goals, which we embraced from the recommendations of the National Priorities Partnership, are to reduce preventable hospital admissions and readmissions, reduce the incidence of adverse health care-associated conditions, and reduce harm from inappropriate or unnecessary care. \\n\\tSo how can we track progress? By establishing quantitative targets and tracking our performance over time, basic “Quality Improvement 101.” For those familiar with the Partnership for Patients initiative, these should look familiar. It's purposeful: we have patient safety as the priority, broad long term goals, more specific aspirational targets, and key metrics for monitoring our performance in coordination with a sponsored, nationwide quality improvement initiative. Similarly, for each of the additional five priorities, we've adopted long term goals, targets, and tracking measures. All of that can be found on the Working for Quality Web site. \\n\\t\",\n",

So we will navigate back to Slide 8 “National Quality Strategy Aims and Priorities,” and have you run through those again. \\n\\tDr. Wilson:  The first is patient safety; the second is person- and family- centered care; the third is effective communication and care coordination; the fourth is prevention and treatment of the leading causes of mortality, starting with cardiovascular disease; the fifth is health and well-being; and the sixth is making quality care affordable. \\n\\tI know that the last two priorities—\"health an well-being\" and \"making quality care affordable\"—are also aims. We really felt that the additional emphasis on moving beyond health care and making the link between health of people within a community and health care was necessary. There have been recent studies supported by the Institute of Medicine showing that if we really want to bend the cost curve on health care that we have to address the social determinants of health. We need to care for the \"pre-patient\" -- people in communities before they ever cross the door into health care. \\n\\t',\n",

Could you go into greater detail on what that group is focused on accomplishing? \\n\\tDr. Wilson:  We created this group a year ago now to align the measures that are used in various agencies inside HHS to monitor programs and providers participating in various programs. What we found is that frequently we'd measure the same construct, such as blood pressure control, in many different ways with very small differences in the how the measures were defined. So if you look across the Department of Health and Human Services at what the Indian Health Service is using, versus what Health Resources and Services Administration is using for their community health centers, versus what the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is using, there were slight differences. So our initial focus was to identify for any given construct or concept (like blood pressure control) the laundry list of measures used across multiple programs and to come to consensus on using the same measures, preferably a National Quality Forum-endorsed measure. We worked over the course of the last calendar year to align around smoking cessation, hypertension, depression, hospital acquired infections, patient experience, and care coordination. We began working around the e-specification of care coordination measures, but I have to say we have a lot more work to do. We also looked for opportunities to simplify across the various agencies the implementation of Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems surveys. \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': \"So those were our initial forays. But we as a group, the senior leaders across all the agencies within HHS, agreed that there is much more to getting to measures that matter than simply retrospectively aligning measures. We really need to be thinking in a coordinated fashion what are the priorities for filling gaps, how do we retire measures, how do we fund measure development across the department so that we are not duplicating effort, and how do we make sure we're being the best stewards of taxpayer dollars. \\n\\t\",\n",

       " {'text': 'So that\\'s work that we\\'re moving into, in addition to now tackling perinatal measures. We\\'re identifying opportunities to align and define a core set of measures for that particular topic. \\n\\tQuestion 4 (Ann Gordon):  Another question about the priorities. Can you say more about why you chose to use the word \"person\" rather than \"patient\" in Priority 2 (person- and family-centered care)? \\n\\tDr. Wilson:  We have learned over the years that many people who engage with the health care system don\\'t particularly view themselves as patients. The first example that comes to mind is folks with long-term disabilities. They may have health issues but tend to view themselves in a more holistic fashion. The term “patient”–and it may be a fad –gets a bit of a bad rap for reinforcing the power differential between the patient and the provider or clinician. So I think there\\'s a growing consensus to emphasize person- and family- centered care. And it\\'s also to emphasize a role for us as health care providers to begin to think, again, beyond the boundaries of what we typically define as the health care delivery system and think about how we support people staying healthy and not becoming patients in the first place. So it pushes us outside the box of only dealing with people who enter the door. \\n\\t',\n",

Can you review Slide 7 “The Triple Aim and the Three Aims” again? \\n\\tDr. Wilson:  Sure. Don Berwick and colleagues coined the phrase the \"Triple Aim\" at least ten years ago. It really provides a fabulous focus on the Patient Experience, including the quality of care; Improving the Health of Populations; and on Reducing the Per Person Annual Cost of Health Care. We saw that as a great foundation for the National Quality Strategy, and in fact, Don Berwick was acting head of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the time we were developing the initial Strategy in 2010.

These are things like access to food markets and fresh foods. If we have nothing in the vending machines in our school systems, how do we expect to even begin to tackle the childhood obesity issues? It\\'s looking not only at individual\\'s responsibility and support for individual behavioral determinants of health, but also considering how can communities support the health of the people that live in those communities. Studies have shown that health care only contributes 9 percent to the health of the population and I remember having finished nursing school, medical school, residency, and I read that study and I said, \"Really?\" Those studies have been repeated and push the impact of health care on the health of population to about 20 percent. That means there are a whole lot of other things we have to think about to help people stay healthy. Whether all those items are part of a broader health care system or not, I think it behooves us who are passionate about helping people to think about the broader opportunities. The other reason this is part of the National Quality Strategy is because our challenge, our mandate from the Affordable Care Act was to improve the delivery system, improve health outcomes, and improve population health. It challenged us to the think beyond the 20 percent influence from the traditional delivery system. \\n\\t',\n",

Our senior researchers reviewed and reconciled the categorizations. A report was assigned only one category for quality of evidence. It was then assigned at least two conceptual domains and could have multiple safety issues and safety solutions. We revised the categories to include safety issues and safety solutions that emerged as we reviewed the literature. The safety issues and solutions are defined and illustrated with examples in  Appendix E . \\n\\t',\n",

It features the implementation and evaluation of a number of strategies (screening, medication) involving primary care practices. \\n\\tAHRQ’s Academy for Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care has developed a document titled “Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder Playbook,” which is an updated, searchable compendium of tools and resources. \\n\\tAHRQ has instituted a new database within the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample makes possible national-level analyses of ambulatory-surgery-related care. HCUP data from emergency departments were used to support predictive analytics on air quality, aiding responses to wildfires in California. \\n\\tAnalytics from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) produced updated results indicating continuing declines in the percentages of eligible private-sector employees who are enrolled in health insurance at establishments that offer it. \\n\\tA study using MEPS data showed that, while rural residents receive mental health medications at rates similar to those of urban residents, the rural residents have fewer than half as many office visits.

The synthetic data maintain statistical properties of original data while protecting the privacy of people and institutions. Many applications are possible. \\n\\tMs. Levine reported that for FY 2020 AHRQ is operating under a continuing resolution based on the 2019 funding level. The resolution ceases on the day of this meeting. However, a new continuing resolution should be signed by the end of the day. That will ensure a $338 million budget for AHRQ. Ms. Levine suggested that the eventual enacted budget will likely lie between the House mark of $358.2 million and the President’s lower budget request.

The problem of obesity continues, with an estimate that today’s 2-year-old children will advance to an obesity prevalence of nearly 60 percent by age 35. Significant inequalities in U.S. life expectancies exist throughout the Nation. Significantly high rates of infant mortality occur in the Appalachian and Delta regions. \\n\\tDr. States referred to a report that suggested health-related behaviors have a stronger influence on health than do genetics, environment, and medical care. Another study found that nearly one-half of U.S. cancer cases are preventable. Nearly one-half of deaths due to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes in the United States could be prevented using simple dietary adjustments. The failure of many Americans to meet suggested levels of aerobic physical activity leads to $117 billion in annual healthcare costs and 10 percent of premature mortality. A study of more than 4,000 individuals aged 65 and older followed for 18 years found that older adults who adhere to four or five healthy behaviors experienced a 60 percent lower risk for developing Alzheimer’s dementia. \\n\\t',\n",

This group can help win the support and interest of important community groups and other stakeholders, including local health care organizations and purchasers. This support is critical if your CAHPS project is the first effort of its kind in your area, and especially if you want it to serve as a springboard for further initiatives to measure and improve health care quality. \\n\\tAdvice.  This group can provide crucial advice on ways to incorporate a CAHPS project into the community's current and future efforts to inform various audiences about health care quality. They can also offer guidance on design, implementation, and communication issues. \\n\\tFeedback.  An advisory group offers a mechanism for keeping stakeholders informed and eliciting their feedback on the project and the survey results. This is especially important for State-sponsored projects that must obtain public feedback. \\n\\tChannels.  The group can serve as a key link to distribution channels for survey results. Members may suggest dissemination strategies or provide access to information venues that would not otherwise be available to the project sponsors. \\n\\tTip: Include someone from the project team.  To ensure continuity and clear communication, create some overlap between your project team and the advisory group. One way to do this is to include in the advisory group at least one key member of the project team; this person will serve as a liaison and contact person for the group. Be sure to select someone who is in a position to act on the group's suggestions. \\n\\tHealth care organizations (particularly those whose quality is being assessed, but also those likely to review and use the results, such as health plans) \\n\\tEmployers and other purchasers (e.g., county or State agencies such as Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program [SCHIP]) \\n\\tOutside technical experts. (Depending on the project, it may be useful to include experts in fields like literacy or survey research. These specialists can provide guidance on issues that are important to consider in planning and carrying out the survey project but may be beyond the project team's expertise. They may also lend greater authority and credibility to the project.) \\n\\tTip: Set clear expectations from the outset.  Members of the advisory group should understand your expectations for their involvement from the beginning, even before they agree to participate. For example, if you expect mainly just to keep the committee informed of the project's progress, but they expect to have a decisionmaking role, they may feel very dissatisfied with their experience in the group and, by extension, with the project. \\n\\tAre there any barriers to conducting the survey that advisory group members can help you overcome (e.g., getting sample frames from employers, health plans, or other health care organizations)? \\n\\tWho would be best suited to playing the roles you have identified for the group? (List specific individuals if possible; if not, list the types of people that would be useful [e.g., a medical director of a health plan].) \\n\\tWho will be responsible for recruiting the advisory group members? This person should document the names and affiliation of everyone who is invited to participate and their responses. \\n\\tWho will be responsible for arranging meetings and maintaining communication with the advisory group? \\n\\tIt is not critical to establish a formal advisory group. However, if you choose not to form such a group, find ways to involve representatives of stakeholder groups right from the beginning. The extent and nature of their involvement will vary by project and type of stakeholder. \\n\\tAt a minimum, the project team should periodically communicate with these individuals and groups to keep them well-informed about the project and its purpose and to seek their ideas and feedback on the project.\\n\\t\",\n",

In addition, they share their findings with PAMF leaders, staff, and managers. These findings can be used to inform organizational improvement efforts. \\n\\tNearly 200 indepth interviews and focus groups with organizational leaders, physicians leaders, and frontline physicians and staff. \\n\\tA baseline and followup survey fielded to approximately 900 primary care physicians and nonphysician staff at PAMF. \\n\\tAdditional details on this study beyond those presented here can be found in the peer-reviewed literature (visit  Appendix ). \\n\\tLean is an increasingly popular strategy to improve short-term efficiency and quality while also promising longer term system transformation. 1 , 2  While views vary widely as to what constitutes Lean in health care, it is typically \"used as a process improvement approach focusing on three main areas: \\n\\tTo date, most studies of Lean have focused on a narrow use of Lean techniques to solve isolated problems. 4  Few studies have focused on Lean\\'s contributions to creating more systemic change. Furthermore, few studies rigorously examine Lean implementation in outpatient primary care settings. \\n\\tIn late 2011, in response to external market pressures for greater affordability, PAMF introduced Lean to improve quality and efficiency across the delivery system. PAMF is a large, not-for-profit, ambulatory care system with clinics very similar to those found in many not-for-profit medical groups across the United States. 5 \\n\\tThe system\\'s nearly 1 million patients are primarily insured by commercial fee-for-service plans (70%); others are insured by commercial health maintenance organizations (HMOs) (12%), have Medicare/Medicaid (13%), or use other forms of payment (5%). Before Lean was introduced, workflows and processes were not highly standardized across PAMF clinics, but all used a single electronic record and financial system. \\n\\tPAMF introduced Lean redesigns in three consecutive phases beginning in primary care (i.e., Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics), each with an implementation period of approximately 4 to 6 months. Implementation of Lean redesigns started in primary care departments housed within one pilot clinic location at the end of 2011, followed in 2012 with three more \"beta\" clinics, and finally the remaining 13 \"gamma\" clinics at the end of 2012 through 2013 (a total of 46 primary care departments across PAMF). \\n\\t',\n",

The pilot site had effective, thoughtful leaders who routinely followed up with frontline physicians and staff to ensure that the redesign was working. The pilot site continues to experience one of the highest levels of sustainment of Lean redesigns. In locations where the implementation approach was more top down and less well received, the Lean approach has not been as fully implemented or sustained. \\n\\tDespite some initial resistance from frontline physicians, the largest successes of Lean redesigns in terms of sustaining changes included  co-location  of medical assistants and physicians and  5S , which involved reorganizing and standardizing exam room supplies. \\n\\tThe most significant post-Lean improvements evident in our statistical analyses involved  workflow efficiencies, physician productivity, clinical quality, and patient satisfaction  ( Table 1 ). \\n\\tEmployees indicated a high level of adherence to Lean redesigns, with both physicians and nonphysician staff reporting that they used  huddles  most of the time to carry out their work and could conduct  agenda setting  with patients for more than half of visits. \\n\\tWhile survey respondents reported that they could manage messages in the physician\\'s  in basket  \"most of the time,\" many interviewees thought that in-basket management had yet to be optimized due to an increasing volume of items. \\n\\tSome evidence suggested that PAMF engendered  cultural change  in terms of its management structure and employee engagement. However, the changes were not enough to counteract effects of continuing pressures on caregivers and fee-for-service reimbursement. \\n\\tSome physicians and administrative leaders cited  inadequate staff training  and a lack of  role competency,  particularly among the medical assistants, as reasons for Lean redesigns not being sustained. \\n\\tWhile clinics and departments continue to engage in continuous frontline improvement activities, finding  adequate time  to do so has been challenging. There is considerable interest among frontline staff in participating in these activities, but busy clinic schedules coupled with a need to prioritize real-time problems have proved to be significant obstacles. \\n\\tSurvey respondents reported that the medical assistant-physician  dyads  created by the Lean redesign were a positive change, and they believe that Lean has improved  overall flow and efficiency . On the other hand, the  speed of implementation  and the  current staffing levels  were noted frequently as areas for improvement. \\n\\tHigh-performing physicians  were more likely to be found in departments identified as less busy or chaotic and departments with a low level (vs. high or medium level) of burnout in the form of depersonalizing patients. \\n\\tIncrease in timeliness of completing 3 of 4 patient encounter measures: office visit chart closures, medication renewals, telephone responses. \\n\\tLower total operating expenses (including constituent components of staff compensation, and drug and supply costs) standardized per tRVU ↑ . \\n\\tImprovements in coordinated diabetes care metrics, no change in preventive screening metrics, and decreased meningococcal immunization among adolescents. \\n\\tHigher satisfaction overall and in specific domains, including access to care and handling of personal issues. Lower satisfaction with interactions with care providers. \\n\\tHigher satisfaction overall and in specific domains, including credible leadership, employee engagement, growth and development, connection to purpose, healthy partnerships, empowerment, and autonomy. \\n\\tIn pilot and beta clinics: Higher satisfaction overall and in specific domains, including time spent working and relationships with staff.

Across all clinics, physician satisfaction increased in key areas, including relationship with staff, quality of care, resources available, and time spent working. \\n\\tAs organizations across the spectrum—ranging from hospitals and physician practices to government programs such as the Veterans Health Administration—implement Lean to improve efficiency and value, a better understanding is needed of how Lean can be effectively scaled and sustained in outpatient settings.

PA SPREAD had its origins in the Pennsylvania Chronic Care Initiative and efforts to improve diabetes care in the State dating back to 2007.

Practice coaches acted as conveners, skill builders, knowledge brokers, and problem solvers in order to help practices achieve their transformation goals. Coaches provided onsite practice facilitation as well as monthly written feedback on reported changes. They also held individual conference calls to evaluate the testing and implementation of critical changes, address specific questions and concerns, and assist the teams in monitoring and using data to define improvement (i.e., goals). Additionally, practice coaches helped facilitate collaboration between participating practices by organizing onsite visits for practices wishing to see exactly how processes were implemented at other sites.

This led to the development of trust between partners statewide, which was critical to the program\\'s overall success. \\n\\tA defining feature of PA SPREAD was the general contractor model, where the program acted as a hub for practices to help them access needed information and expertise.

He is also the Director of the Stanford UCSF Evidence-based Practice Center. Owens reports that nearly a dozen EPC reports have been used to create ACP guidelines. ACP also used AHRQ\\'s Effective Health Care guide on depression medications. \\n\\t\"AHRQ\\'s EPC program has enabled the ACP to base our guidelines on very rigorous evidence. AHRQ research has made our guidelines better,\" Owens says. \\n\\tSince January 2007, ACP guidelines have had an estimated reach of 340 million people. The individual guidelines have been downloaded tens, even hundreds of thousands of times. \\n\\tAccording to Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA, FACP, Senior Medical Associate at the American College of Physicians, who is responsible for the ACP\\'s clinical practice guidelines program, these guidelines have reached wide audiences via print, television, and the internet. He shares specific examples, as follows: \\n\\tBeginning its guideline program 28 years ago, the ACP has one of the oldest guideline programs in existence, Owens notes. \"The EPC reports are now our primary source for developing ACP guidelines,\" he says. \\n\\tIn the four years since Owens became Chair of ACP\\'s guidelines committee, ACP\\'s use of EPC reports in creating guidelines has increased fourfold. \"In 2005, few of our guidelines were based on EPC reports; now, most are,\" he says. \\n\\t\"We look for very rigorous evidence-based reviews,\" explains Owens. \"AHRQ has been a leader in producing these high quality reviews.\" \\n\\tQaseem says, \"AHRQ does a really comprehensive and wonderful job with their evidence reviews, and EPC reviews are the gold standard of systematic reviews.\" \\n\\tThe ACP also used AHRQ\\'s Effective Health Care summary on antidepressants,  Comparative Effectiveness of Second-Generation Antidepressants in the Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Depression , in developing a treatment guideline for depression in adults. \\n\\tACP is the largest medical specialty organization and second largest physician group in the United States. Its membership of 126,000 includes internists, internal medicine subspecialists, medical students, residents, and fellows. \\n\\tAHRQ EPC reports are available by visiting  http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/index.html . \\n\\t',\n",

There is also limited evidence of the safety of antiviral therapy in pregnant women and neonates. \\n\\tAntiviral therapy improves health outcomes in symptomatic persons (e.g., those with multiple recurrences); however, here is no evidence that the use of antiviral therapy improves health outcomes in those with asymptomatic infection. There are multiple efficacious regimens that may be used to prevent the recurrence of clinical genital herpes. \\n\\tThe potential harms of screening asymptomatic pregnant women include false-positive test results, labeling, and anxiety, as well as false-negative tests and false reassurance, although these potential harms are not well studied. The USPSTF determined that there are no benefits associated with screening, and therefore the potential harms outweigh the benefits. \\n\\tThe potential harms of screening asymptomatic adolescents and adults include false-positive test results, labeling, and anxiety, although these potential harms are not well studied. The USPSTF determined the benefits of screening are minimal, at best, and the potential harms outweigh the potential benefits. \\n\\tThe USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, and several other sexually transmitted infections.

In the 2-step approach, the 50-g oral glucose challenge test is administered between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state. If the screening threshold is met or exceeded (7.22 mmol/L [130 mg/dL], 7.50 mmol/L [135 mg/dL], or 7.77 mmol/L [140 mg/dL]), patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test. A diagnosis of GDM is made when 2 or more glucose levels meet or exceed the specified glucose thresholds. In the 1-step approach, a 75-g glucose load is administered after fasting and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 hours.

Most tests that are available in a primary care setting do not have acceptable accuracy to detect glaucoma. \\n\\tThe immediate physiologic goal and measure of effect of primary treatment of glaucoma is reduction in intraocular pressure. Treatments that are effective in reducing intraocular pressure include medications, laser therapy, and surgery.

Newer screening tests, including nucleic acid amplification and hybridization tests, have demonstrated improved sensitivity and comparable specificity when compared with cervical culture. Some newer tests can be used with urine and vaginal swabs, which enables screening when a pelvic examination is not performed. \\n\\tScreening is recommended at the first prenatal visit for pregnant women who are in a high-risk group for gonorrhea infection. For pregnant women who are at continued risk, and for those who acquire a new risk factor, a second screening should be conducted during the third trimester. The optimal interval for screening in the non-pregnant population is not known. \\n\\tGenital gonorrhea infection in men and women, including pregnant women, may be treated with a third-generation cephalosporin.

An even smaller proportion of these individuals will develop advanced stages of clinical disease. \\n\\tGenetic screening for  HFE  mutations can accurately identify individuals at risk for hereditary hemochromatosis. However, identifying an individual with the genotypic predisposition does not accurately predict the future risk for disease manifestation. \\n\\tTherapeutic phlebotomy is the main treatment for hereditary hemochromatosis. Phlebotomy is generally thought to have few side effects. \\n\\tScreening could lead to identification of a large number of individuals who possess the high-risk genotype but may never manifest the clinical disease. This may result in unnecessary surveillance and diagnostic procedures, labeling, anxiety, and, potentially, unnecessary treatments. \\n\\tThere is poor evidence that early therapeutic phlebotomy improves morbidity and mortality in individuals with screening-detected versus clinically-detected hemochromatosis. \\n\\tThe USPSTF concluded that the potential harms of genetic screening for hereditary hemochromatosis outweigh the potential benefits. \\n\\tThe USPSTF has also made recommendations on genetic testing for mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene to predict breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.

Additional risk factors include receiving a blood transfusion before 1992, long-term hemodialysis, being born to an HCV-infected mother, incarceration, intranasal drug use, getting an unregulated tattoo, and other percutaneous exposures.\\n\\t\\t\\t Adults born between 1945 and 1965 are more likely to be diagnosed with HCV infection, either because they received a blood transfusion before the introduction of screening in 1992 or because they have a history of other risk factors for exposure decades earlier. \\n\\tAnti–HCV antibody testing followed by confirmatory polymerase chain reaction testing accurately identifies patients with chronic HCV infection. Various noninvasive tests with good diagnostic accuracy are possible alternatives to liver biopsy for diagnosing fibrosis or cirrhosis. \\n\\tPersons with continued risk for HCV infection (such as injection drug users) should be screened periodically. Evidence on how often screening should occur in these persons is lacking. Adults born between 1945 and 1965 and persons who are at risk because of potential exposure before universal blood screening need only be screened once. \\n\\tAntiviral treatment prevents long-term health complications of HCV infection (such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma).\\n\\t\\t\\t The combination of pegylated interferon (α-2a or α-2b) and ribavirin is the standard treatment for HCV infection. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection (the predominant genotype in the United States). \\n\\tOn the basis of the accuracy of HCV antibody testing and the availability of effective interventions for persons with HCV infection, the USPSTF concludes that there is a moderate net benefit to screening in populations at high risk for infection. The USPSTF concludes that there is also a moderate net benefit to 1-time screening in all adults in the United States born between 1945 and 1965. \\n\\tThe USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for hepatitis B virus infection in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women.

JNC 7 guidelines for treatment of hypertension can be accessed at  http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension/jncintro.htm .\\n\\t\\t\\t Adults should be screened for hyperlipidemia (depending on age, sex, risk factors) and smoking.

Other persons at high risk include those who have acquired or request testing for other sexually transmitted infections.\\n\\tThe USPSTF recognizes that the above categories are not mutually exclusive, the degree of sexual risk is on a continuum, and individuals may not be aware of their sexual partners' risk factors for HIV infection. \\n\\tThe conventional serum test for diagnosing HIV infection is repeatedly reactive immunoassay, followed by confirmatory Western blot or immunofluorescent assay. Conventional HIV test results are available within 1 to 2 days from most commercial laboratories.\\n\\t\\t\\t Rapid HIV testing may use either blood or oral fluid specimens and can provide results in 5 to 40 minutes; however, initial positive results require confirmation with conventional methods. \\n\\tOther U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved tests for detection and confirmation of HIV infection include combination tests (for p24 antigen and HIV antibodies) and qualitative HIV-1 RNA. \\n\\tAt present, there is no cure for chronic HIV infection. However, appropriately timed interventions in HIV-positive persons can reduce risks for clinical progression, complications or death from the disease, and disease transmission. Effective interventions include antiretroviral therapy (ART) (specifically, the use of combined ART), immunizations, and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. \\n\\tThe net benefit of screening for HIV infection in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women is substantial. \\n\\tThe USPSTF has made recommendations on behavioral counseling to prevent sexually transmitted infections.

Depending on the type of intervention, these services may be provided by clinicians, nurses, social workers, nonclinician mentors, or community workers. \\n\\tScreening and interventions for IPV in women of childbearing age are associated with moderate health improvements through the reduction of exposure to abuse, physical and mental harms, and mortality. The associated harms are deemed no greater than small. Therefore, the overall net benefit is moderate. \\n\\tThe USPSTF was not able to estimate the magnitude of net benefit for screening all elderly or vulnerable adults (i.e., adults who are physically or mentally dysfunctional) for abuse and neglect because there were no studies on the accuracy, effectiveness, or harms of screening in this population. \\n\\tThe USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for depression in adults and screening and counseling to reduce alcohol misuse in adults.

Risk factors for CHD include diabetes, history of previous CHD or atherosclerosis, family history of cardiovascular disease, tobacco use, hypertension, and obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m 2 ). \\n\\tThe preferred screening tests for dyslipidemia are measuring serum lipid (total cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels in non-fasting or fasting samples. Abnormal screening results should be confirmed by a repeated sample on a separate occasion, and the average of both results should be used for risk assessment. \\n\\tThe optimal interval for screening is uncertain. Reasonable options include every 5 years, shorter intervals for people who have lipid levels close to those warranting therapy, and longer intervals for those not at increased risk who have had repeatedly normal lipid levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t An age at which to stop screening has not been established. Screening may be appropriate in older people who have never been screened; repeated screening is less important in older people because lipid levels are less likely to increase after age 65 years. \\n\\tDrug therapy is usually more effective than diet alone in improving lipid profiles, but choice of treatment should consider overall risk, costs of treatment, and patient preferences. Guidelines for treating lipid disorders are available from the National Cholesterol Education Program of the National Institutes of Health ( http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/ncep/ ). \\n\\tThe benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in men age 35 and older and women age 45 and older at increased risk for CHD substantially outweigh the potential harms \\n\\tThe benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in young adults at increased risk for CHD moderately outweigh the potential harms. \\n\\tThe net benefits of screening for lipid disorders in young adults not at increased risk for CHD are not sufficient to make a general recommendation. \\n\\tThe USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for lipid disorders in children and screening for carotid artery stenosis, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, and peripheral arterial disease.

Risk factors for a specific chronic disease or individual characteristics that affect the likelihood of a specific therapy-associated adverse event may cause a woman's net balance of benefits and harms to differ from that of the average population. \\n\\tAlthough combined estrogen and progestin therapy (specifically, oral conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d) decreases the risk for fractures in postmenopausal women, there is an accompanying increased risk for serious adverse events, such as stroke, invasive breast cancer, dementia, gallbladder disease, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.\\n\\t\\t\\t Estrogen therapy (specifically, oral conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 mg/d) decreases the risk for fractures and has a small effect on the risk for invasive breast cancer, but it is also associated with important harms, such as an increased likelihood of stroke, deep venous thrombosis, and gallbladder disease. \\n\\tNeither combined estrogen and progestin therapy nor estrogen alone reduces the risk for coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women. \\n\\tThe chronic disease prevention benefits of combined estrogen and progestin do not outweigh the harms in most postmenopausal women. \\n\\tThe chronic disease prevention benefits of estrogen are unlikely to outweigh the harms in most postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. \\n\\tThe USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for osteoporosis and the use of preventive medications for breast cancer, as well as other relevant interventions for the primary or secondary prevention of chronic diseases in women, such as medications for cardiovascular disease and screening for coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, lipid disorders, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and dementia.

Possible harms of behavioral weight-loss interventions include decreased bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, serious injuries resulting from increased physical activity, and increased risk for eating disorders. \\n\\tRecommendations on screening for obesity in children and adolescents can be found at  http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org . \\n\\tFor a summary of the evidence systematically reviewed in making this recommendation, the full recommendation statement, and supporting documents, please go to  http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/ . \\n\\tTobacco use in all forms is the biggest risk factor for oral cancer. Alcohol abuse combined with tobacco use increases risk.\\n\\t\\t\\t Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of oral cancer when treating patients who use tobacco or alcohol. \\n\\tDirect inspection and palpation of the oral cavity is the most commonly recommended method of screening for oral cancer, although there are little data on the sensitivity and specificity of this method. Screening techniques other than inspection and palpation are being evaluated but are still experimental. \\n\\tPatients should be encouraged to not use tobacco and to limit alcohol use in order to decrease their risk for oral cancer, as well as for heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and cirrhosis. \\n\\tThere is no good-quality evidence that screening for oral cancer leads to improved health outcomes for either high-risk adults (i.e., adults older than age 50 years who use tobacco) or average-risk adults in the general population. It is unlikely that controlled trials of screening for oral cancer will ever be conducted in the general population because of the very low incidence of oral cancer in the United States.

The choice of treatment should take into account the patient's clinical situation and the tradeoff between benefits and harms.

It is important for the team to think that this effort is doable and builds on their strengths. \\n\\tThe Facilitator pointed out that policies and procedures related to risk factors for hospitalizations are more likely to already exist. The strategy is to identify which are the most important risk factors and work to prevent declines in these risk factors to encourage earlier interventions so that the overall risk of hospitalization will not increase. This is in contrast to waiting for hospitalizations to occur before intervening. \\n\\tThe Facilitator identified ways the On-Time reports can save staff time when discussion allows these insights. \\n\\tThe Facilitator helped the team see how reports could help introduce prevention during existing meetings or huddles. \\n\\tThe Facilitator reassured the team that he will work with them to help them integrate the reports into their existing meetings and help them with new meetings, if needed.

The handouts we will use include a filled in Menu of Implementation Strategies, the Communication Practice grid from the Self-Assessment Worksheet, and a Meetings Description document. \\n\\tSince nursing home staff may call meetings by different names, the Meetings Description document was created to help clarify the content of meetings and huddles listed in the Menu.

Once they decide, the team will determine if they have existing meetings that meet their needs or if a new meeting is needed. \\n\\tThe Change Team then decides how to pilot the use of the reports. They may opt to trial one or more of the reports on one unit and then gradually roll the use of the reports out to the entire facility, as is commonly done, or implement across the facility at one time. It is important to focus on the strategies the Facilitator takes in working with the team during this discussion. \\n\\tIn reality, a change team may make these decisions over a number of change team meetings. But for purposes of familiarizing the Facilitator with his or her role, the exercise treats this as one session. \\n\\tIf multiple meetings occur without progress by the team toward making decisions about implementing the reports, the Facilitator should offer strategies to hasten the decisionmaking process (e.g., assist the team to set timeline goals for decisions, attempt to determine what barriers may be impeding progress toward implementation). Before we begin the scripted exercise, let’s spend 10 minutes reviewing the materials provided as handouts. \\n\\tIn our previous exercise the facilitator helped the team to use the Self-Assessment to identify how the nursing home staff t currently try to prevent hospital transfers.. The Facilitator also assist the team in selecting reports that they want to use and determining how and in which meetings or other venues they will use them. In addition to making these decisions, considerations for the change team at this point of the implementation process include whether the reports will be trialed on all units or certain units and, if trialed on certain units, how and when they will be rolled out to others. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'Colorado and New Mexico made strengthening SBHCs’ PCMH features a priority under the CHIPRA quality demonstration because of SBHCs’ de facto role as medical homes, providing primary care for many children, especially adolescents. In some rural areas, SBHCs are the only primary care providers for children and adolescents. \\n\\t“For a lot of kids, these SBHCs are their primary provider. In the poorer areas, parents . . . can’t take off work, and they can’t drive. It’s very convenient for parents to have an SBHC to treat [their children].”\\n\\tSpecifically, the States took advantage of the opportunity presented by the CHIPRA quality demonstration to build upon the SBHCs’ existing PCMH infrastructure. Prior to the CHIPRA quality demonstration, a few participating SBHCs were already recognized as PCMHs. Several others, though not formally recognized, possessed a number of medical home features. \\n\\tMany SBHCs were already working toward providing more comprehensive preventive services by screening their adolescent patients for depression and obesity. For example, the SBHCs in New Mexico were using a paper version of the Student Health Questionnaire (SHQ), 8  and one SBHC in Colorado was using the Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services (RAAPS) 9  to screen patients for health and behavioral risk factors \\n\\tColorado and New Mexico help demonstration SBHCs improve quality by incorporating many PCMH features into their daily operations. States use three basic strategies to do this: \\n\\tStates use practice facilitators to help SBHCs with data-driven improvement.  A commitment to high quality and quality improvement is one feature of a PCMH. Both States are using grant funds from the CHIPRA quality demonstration to pay for practice facilitators 10  (known in these States as quality improvement coaches) to help SBHCs incorporate many PCMH features into their operations. \\n\\tPractice facilitators guide SBHCs in reviewing their data, facilitating quality improvement projects, and setting quality improvement goals through site visits, Webinars, and telephone calls. For example, practice facilitators help SBHCs establish registries for patients with certain conditions (e.g., depression) in order to monitor them for appropriate followup and referrals to specialists. They also help SBHCs collect data on patient needs through routine screenings using tablet computers. In the first few years of the demonstration, practice facilitators also helped some SBHCs transition from paper screenings to electronic screenings on tablets. Colorado and New Mexico, as well as the stakeholders and health care providers in both States, expect these activities to yield positive results in several areas, particularly in reproductive health, behavioral health, and preventive care. \\n\\t',\n",

Practice facilitators also taught SBHCs how to use their EHRs for population management, such as identifying the charts that should be selected for biannual medical record reviews. \\n\\tTwo quality improvements in particular can be tied directly to these efforts: (1) an EHR “trigger function” that reminds SBHC providers when patients are due for preventive services and (2) visit templates, which some SBHCs created to ensure that all components of well-child visits, sexually transmitted infection screenings, and depression and anxiety visits are addressed and documented.

These States used CHIPRA quality demonstration funds to partly or fully pay for the care coordinators. \\n\\tThe other three States did not require practices to embed a care coordinator in their care team. Massachusetts deployed care coordinators from the State Department of Public Health’s (DPH) Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program to mentor practice staff in building care coordination systems. Alaska and Oregon focused on educating practices about the broad functions of care coordination, allowing the specific strategies for fulfilling these functions to develop organically in each practice and allowing each practice to decide whether a care coordinator would be the most effective way to coordinate care. Using their own funds, all practices in Alaska and Oregon decided to hire care coordinators. \\n\\t',\n",

       " {'text': 'The transmission of pathogens is affected by variations and practices of human behaviors, such as hand hygiene compliance or the effectiveness of room cleaning. There are multiple opportunities within the built environment to interrupt the transmission of pathogens, including reducing or preventing contamination of surfaces or water sources, providing barriers to interrupt transmission events, and influencing human behavior, such as by promoting hand hygiene compliance (Figure). \\n\\tThe figure is a conceptual model that illustrates the linkages between health care facility design elements and the acquisition and prevention of HAIs. It shows how infectious agents can be brought into hospitals by colonized or infected hosts or other external sources and lead to HAIs. It also illustrates how various barriers and decontamination can be designed to prevent such infections. \\n\\t[D] Text Description:  The flow chart depicts the movement of pathogens through the built environment in a health care facility. There are human reservoirs and environmental sources and reservoirs of pathogens. A reservoir is the place (human or environmental) where organisms reside and multiply. A source is the place from which an organism is transmitted to the host, which may be the same as the reservoir or it may be a surface or instrument. A transmission event is direct or indirect contact, including transient carriage (e.g., hands of a health care worker) of a pathogen in airborne or droplet form. Contamination may come from an external source (colonized or infected host, including patients, health care workers, and visitors) or an external source. Opportunities to interrupt transmission from an external source include barriers, filters, and design elements. Opportunities to interrupt transmission from a colonized or infected host include hand hygiene, other barriers, isolation, and design elements. Once the contamination has reached the reservoir or source in the hospital, intervention may include disinfection, decontamination, and elimination of the pathogen. If interventions are not successful, the pathogen results in a health care-associated infection in a patient, health care worker, or visitor. \\n\\t',\n",

Similarly, assessing the impact design features have in mitigating transmission also can be difficult. Most studies of design interventions assess intermediate endpoints, such as the reduction of environmental contamination by known pathogens. Studies that look at the acquisition of organisms by a patient are more difficult to conduct and are confounded by other factors that contribute to the spread of organisms, including human behavior, such as hand hygiene compliance. Studies that use the development of infections as the outcome are difficult to conduct because of the relative infrequency of infections. Despite the inherent difficulties in establishing definitive links between the built environment and HAIs, sufficiently strong evidence exists to inform design and design guidelines.

       " {'text': 'This executive summary briefly describes a multidisciplinary assessment of the current state of knowledge about HAIs within the context of the built environment. Major findings from the literature review are summarized here. \\n\\tContact transmission, either via person-to-person contact or with the environment as an intermediary, is the primary mechanism by which organisms are transmitted in health care settings. Contact with contaminated surfaces can lead to transmission of pathogens, with health care workers often acting as the transmitting agent. Current environmental cleaning processes are suboptimal, primarily because of inconsistent application of disinfectants. Alternative surface materials, such as copper alloys, provide continuous antimicrobial activity; although promising, the impact of copper high-touch surfaces on infection risk is unclear. Novel technologies, such as in-duct ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and hydrogen peroxide applied as a mist or vapor, merit continued investigation as potential strategies to enhance environmental cleaning. These technologies have been shown to decrease organisms recovered from surfaces, although their impact on acquisition of organisms and infection risk is less clear. Both technologies are used as part of room cleaning at the time of patient discharge and thus have limited impact on reducing day-to-day contamination. \\n\\t',\n",

An optimized environment can also support behaviors that minimize contact transmission; an example is the promotion of hand hygiene through strategic placement of alcohol hand-rub dispensers in highly visible locations. Some elements in the built environment, such as curtains and carpets, offer increased privacy, noise reduction, fall reduction, and aesthetic value, but there is a tradeoff between these beneficial effects and infection risks. Although curtains and carpets are easily contaminated, hard to clean, and linked to outbreaks of HAIs, their role in the spread of pathogens is unclear. Curtains made from novel antimicrobial materials can partially resist contamination and may prove to be of value. Presently, carpets are not recommended in rooms designated for patients with impaired immune systems. \\n\\t',\n",

Copper silver ionization is strongly supported by recent literature, but adoption of this technology has been slowed by high costs and unknown long-term implications. Several longitudinal studies have shown that UVGI in water systems is effective in controlling  Legionella . These two newer technologies appear to have roles in controlling waterborne pathogens when multiple trials of first-line approaches, such as hyperchlorination and superheating and flushing, have failed. Point-of-use filters are also highly effective at eliminating pathogens and have the advantage of immediate efficacy, but they are costly to install.

Most prevalent is the assertion that the term \"evidence-based design\" is misleading because of the paucity of rigorous research directly linking a design feature or strategy to a reduction in infections. Most experts agreed that the term \"evidence-influenced design\" is a more accurate characterization of the approach used in the majority of today\\'s health care settings, meaning that decisionmakers must use a combination of research and practical experiences to inform design strategies. This necessitates a more collaborative, holistic approach to decisionmaking, replacing the less informed \"siloed\" design process. Many experts stressed that no single intervention will be highly effective in mitigating HAI risk, and that multiple interventions, including those involving the built environment, are needed.
